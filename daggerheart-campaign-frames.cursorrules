## What Are Campaign Frames?

Campaign frames are structured starting points for Daggerheart campaigns that provide inspiration, tools, and mechanics. Each frame has a **complexity rating** indicating how challenging it is to run:

- **Lower complexity**: Sits within traditional fantasy genres, fewer additional mechanics
- **Higher complexity**: Pushes beyond traditional fantasy, more in-depth mechanics, requires GM comfort with "homebrewing" (creating custom stat blocks, equipment, etc.)

## Campaign Frame Structure

Every campaign frame includes these sections:

1. **Pitch** - Brief introduction to present to players
2. **Tone & Feel** - Descriptive words capturing the campaign's atmosphere
3. **Themes** - Core narrative and emotional themes explored
4. **Touchstones** - Cultural references (films, games, books) that shaped the frame
5. **Overview** - Background information for players before character creation
6. **Communities** - How standard Daggerheart communities fit the setting, with unique questions
