During your journeys, you may find yourself rubbing elbows with nobles to\ninvestigate and stop an assassination plot, delving into an ancient dungeon to prevent an\napocalyptic creature from breaking free, sailing across a vast ocean to face a terrifying sea\nmonster, or preventing a precious relic from falling into the hands of a dangerous enemy. No\nmatter the adventure your party embarks upon, Daggerheart provides the tools to tell a story\nthat is both heartfelt and epic.\nWHAT IS A TABLETOP\nROLEPLAYING GAME?\nA tabletop roleplaying game, or TTRPG, is an interactive\nstorytelling experience where players take on the roles of\ncharacters within a shared world and collaborate to tell a story\nabout those characters. Daggerheart is meant to be played\nby three to six people—known as your group or table—with\none person taking on the role of the game master (or GM)\nwhile the others each play a single character, referred to\nas a player character (or PC). The GM facilitates the story\nthat takes shape around the PCs—they introduce rewards,\ncomplications, and consequences to the narrative, embody\nthe story’s other characters (also known as non-player\ncharacters or NPCs), and help the story progress each time\nyou play together.\nLike many roleplaying games, Daggerheart uses dice to\ndetermine the outcome of some uncertain events, providing\nan element of unpredictability to the results of choices\nyou make. Even so, the game embraces player agency and\nimagination; the type of character you choose to play and the\ndecisions you make about their background and experiences\nwill make your odds better (or worse!) on those dice rolls.\nWHAT KIND OF ROLEPLAYING\nGAME IS DAGGERHEART?\nDaggerheart is a heroic, narrative-focused experience that\nfeatures combat as a prominent aspect of play. The system\nfacilitates emotionally engaging, player-driven stories\npunctuated by exciting battles and harrowing challenges.\nThe game takes a fiction-first approach, encouraging players\nand GMs to act in good faith with one another and focus on\nthe story they’re telling rather than the complexity of the\nmechanics. The rules provide structure when it’s unclear how\nactions or moments will resolve within that story. The system\ntakes a free-flowing approach to combat to avoid slowing the\ngame down with granular rounds, and it doesn’t rely on grid-\nbased movement for maps and minis. These aspects coalesce\nto create a game that allows for the terrain and map-building\nthat miniature-based systems are known for while facilitating\na streamlined, narrative experience for players.\nIf you’re looking for a TTRPG that tells heroic fantasy stories\nwith a modern approach to mechanics, focusing on both epic\nbattles and the emotional narrative of the characters who\nfight in them, you’ve come to the right place.\nDaggerheart also utilizes an asymmetrical design, meaning\nthat it plays differently for the GM than it does for the players.\nPlayers roll two twelve-sided dice for their PCs’ standard\nactions, including their attacks. The GM can make most\nmoves without dice, but they roll a twenty-sided die for\nadversary moves that require a roll. This asymmetrical\ndesign is intended to help all participants contribute to a\nmemorable experience for everyone at the table.\nHEART OF THE GAME\nIn Daggerheart, you and your fellow players all\ntake turns describing what your characters do. The\nGM determines the consequences of those actions,\nthen guides the group into collaboratively evolving\nthe narrative because of those consequences. When\nthe rules call for it, or when a situation demands,\nyou’ll roll the dice to inform what happens next.\nDepending on the result of the roll, the events\nof the ongoing story will unfold in new and\nunexpected ways.\nThere is no winning or losing in Daggerheart in\nthe traditional “gaming” sense. The game is a collaborative\nstorytelling experience, where the goal is to play out an\nincredible story together. Even if the characters fail to achieve\ntheir goals right away, make big mistakes, or even die, they\nnever “lose.” If a character dies, the party can look for a way\nto bring them back to life, or that player can make a new\ncharacter for the party to meet along their journey. If the\ngroup fails to stop the villain from enacting a terrible plan,\nthey might face the consequences of that failure and try to\nmake it right. If they succeed, they may triumphantly win\nthe day—or they might anger or embolden an even stronger\nenemy who retaliates. No matter what happens during the\nstory, as long as you’re working together to craft a narrative\nthat is fun and exciting to everyone, you’ve already won.\n4\tIntroduction\n\n-- 5 of 415 --\n\n\n\n-- 6 of 415 --\n\nTOUCHSTONES\nDaggerheart derives inspiration from a variety of sources.\nBelow is an abridged list of media the design team drew from\nwhile crafting this game.\nTTRPGs: 13th Age from Pelgrane Press, Apocalypse Keys from\nEvil Hat Productions, Apocalypse World from Lumpley Games,\nBlades in the Dark from Evil Hat Productions, City of Mist from\nSon of Oak Game Studio, Cortex Prime from Fandom Tabletop,\nCypher System from Monte Cook Games, Dishonored from\nModiphius Entertainment, Dungeons & Dragons from Wizards\nof the Coast, Flee, Mortals! from MCDM Productions, For the\nQueen from Darrington Press, Genesys from Fantasy Flight\nGames, Lady Blackbird from One Seven Design, Masks: A\nNew Generation from Magpie Games, Pathfinder from Paizo\nPublishing, Shadowrun from Catalyst Game Labs, The Quiet\nYear from Buried Without Ceremony, The Wildsea from\nMythopoeia Games Publications, Slugblaster from Mythopoeia\nGames Publications.\nBooks: Sabriel by Garth Nix, A Song of Ice and Fire by George\nR.R. Martin, The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien, The Wheel\nof Time by Robert Jordan, A Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula K.\nLe Guin.\nFilms and Television: The Dragon Prince, The Legend of Vox\nMachina, The Lord of the Rings, The Witcher, Guardians of the\nGalaxy, The Dark Crystal.\nVideo Games: Borderlands from Gearbox Software, Dragon\nAge: Inquisition from BioWare, The Elder Scrolls series from\nBethesda Game Studios, Outriders from People Can Fly.\nSpecial Appreciation:\n• The Genesys System from Fantasy Flight Games\nwas a major inspiration for the two-axis results of\nthe Duality Dice.\n• Cypher System from Monte Cook Games and its\nGM Intrusions paved the way for spending Fear to\ninterrupt a scene.\n• Among many other things, Wizards of the Coast’s\nDungeons & Dragons advantage/disadvantage system\nwas particularly inspirational in the dice mechanics of\nthis game.\n• 13th Age from Pelgrane Press developed Backgrounds\nthat heavily inspired the Experience mechanic.\n• Blades in the Dark from Evil Hat Productions and\nApocalypse World from Lumpley Games helped shape the\nnarrative flow of the game, and their playbooks inspired a\nlot of the character sheet development.\n• The Wildsea from Mythopoeia Games Publications and its\nphenomenal section on Reaches provided inspiration for\nthe Campaign Frames section of this book.\n• The design of Wizards of the Coast’s Dungeons & Dragons\nfourth edition and the monster design of Flee, Mortals!\nfrom MCDM Productions informed the enemy types and\nways of managing minions.\n• The Quiet Year from Buried Without Ceremony inspired the\nmap-building section of this book’s campaign guidance.\n• Apocalypse Keys from Evil Hat Productions informed the\nsample session zero structure.\nCORE MECHANICS OVERVIEW\nThe dice players use in Daggerheart most commonly fall into\ntwo different categories—your Duality Dice and your damage\ndice. Your Duality Dice are two differently colored twelve-\nsided dice (or d12s) that represent Hope and Fear. These dice\nembody the fate of the world and its effect on the characters’\nsuccess. Your damage dice correspond to the weapon or\nspell your character wields, expressing the deadliness of a\nsuccessful attack.\nWhen you roll to see whether your character succeeds or fails\nat a task or challenge, you roll your Duality Dice and take the\nsum of their results, then add any bonuses your character has\nthat apply to the action. If that total is equal to or higher than\nthe Difficulty set by the GM, your character succeeds. If it’s\nlower, they fail. You’ll also tell the GM whether your Hope or\nFear Die rolled higher, as the situation around you changes\nbased on that result. We’ll discuss this more in-depth in the\n“Core Mechanics” section of chapter 2.\nSESSIONS AND CAMPAIGNS\nWhen the GM and players gather to play Daggerheart, that\ngame is called a session. Each session is a small story, and if the\ngroup plays more sessions, those small stories become part of\na larger narrative known as a campaign. Longer campaigns may\nbe broken into arcs—multiple sessions collectively focused on\na specific part of the story. If overthrowing a corrupt ruler is a\ncampaign, recruiting allies from a neighboring kingdom is an arc\nwithin that campaign.\nDaggerheart is built to accommodate many kinds of stories. Your\ngroup might enjoy playing an open-ended campaign that lasts\nmonths, meeting every week to continue your characters’ stories\nindefinitely, or you could designate a set number of sessions and\nplay with a definite end point. Your group might enjoy a short ten-\nsession romp with a party of characters before making new ones,\nor you may only want to play one session, known as a “one-shot.”\nAll of those options are wonderful ways to play—do what works\nbest for your group.\n6\tIntroduction\n\n-- 7 of 415 --\n\nTHE GOLDEN RULE\nThe most important rule of Daggerheart is to make the game\nyour own. The rules included in this book are designed to\nhelp you enjoy the experience at the table, but everyone has\na different approach to interpreting rules and telling stories.\nThe rules should never get in the way of the story you want\nto tell, the characters you want to play, or the adventures you\nwant to have. As long as your group agrees, everything can\nbe adjusted to fit your play style. If there’s a rule you’d rather\nignore or modify, feel free to implement any change with your\ntable’s consent.\nRULINGS OVER RULES\nWhile playing Daggerheart, the GM and players should\nalways prioritize rulings over rules. This book offers answers\nfor many questions your table may have about the game, but\nit won’t answer all of them. When you’re in doubt about how\na rule applies, the GM should make a ruling that aligns with\nthe narrative.\nFor example, Daggerheart has a weapon called a grappler that\nlets you pull a target close to you. If you try to use it to pull an\nentire castle, the weapon text doesn’t forbid you from doing\nthat—but it doesn’t make sense within the narrative. Instead,\nthe GM might rule that you pull a few bricks out, or pull\nyourself toward the wall instead.\nSimilarly, if your character does something that would logically\nresult in immediate death—such as diving into an active\nvolcano without protection—you might not get to make\none of Daggerheart’s death moves, which normally give you\ncontrol of your character’s fate in their final moments. This\nkind of consequence should be made clear before the action is\ncompleted, and it should always follow the logic of the world.\nAs a narrative-focused game, Daggerheart is not a place\nwhere technical, out-of-context interpretations of the rules are\nencouraged. Everything should flow back to the fiction, and\nthe GM has the authority and responsibility to make rulings\nabout how rules are applied to underscore that fiction.\nUsing This Book\nThe Daggerheart Core Rulebook is divided into five chapters.\nCHAPTER ONE:\nPREPARING FOR ADVENTURE\nThis chapter covers everything you need to know to make a\ncharacter in the Daggerheart system.\nCHAPTER TWO:\nPLAYING AN ADVENTURE\nThis chapter details the core game mechanics you’ll need to play\na session, as well as how to level up your character, multiclass\nto access new domains, and use special equipment you might\ndiscover during play.\nCHAPTER THREE:\nRUNNING AN ADVENTURE\nThis chapter is specifically for the GM, giving you the tools you’ll\nneed to run sessions and campaigns. In addition to detailing the\ncore GM mechanics, this chapter guides you on using safety\ntools, running session zero, customizing campaign maps,\nplanning story arcs, and more.\nCHAPTER FOUR:\nADVERSARIES AND\nENVIRONMENTS\nThis chapter provides rules and stat blocks for filling your world\nwith challenging adversaries and dynamic environments. You can\nuse the pregenerated adversary and environment stat blocks, or\nfollow this chapter’s guidance to create your own.\nCHAPTER FIVE:\nCAMPAIGN FRAMES\nThis chapter provides campaign frame options you can use to\nstructure long-term play.\nAPPENDIX\nLastly, this is where domain card text, character sheets,\ncharacter guides, maps, and all other reference documentation\nfor the game can be found.\n7\tIntroduction\n\n-- 8 of 415 --\n\nWhat Do You Need to Play?\nMost of the tools required to play a session of Daggerheart are included with this book, but\nthere are a few additional components you’ll need to gather before you begin.\n2–5 PLAYERS\nDaggerheart runs best with two to five players who are\nexcited to collaborate and build a story together. If you’re\nplaying a PC, your responsibility is to adopt the mentality\nof your character and decide what they do. The GM will\npresent problems and obstacles, and you’ll figure out how to\ntackle those challenges in a way that makes your game most\ninteresting. As a player, it’s your job to shape your character’s\nstory through the choices you make and spotlight the other\ncharacters as they, too, grow on this journey.\nA GAME MASTER\nIf you’re taking on the role of the GM, you’ll be playing the\nworld as it responds to the PCs’ actions. That means you’ll\nset exciting scenes for the characters, manage the flow of\nthe story, and play any NPCs, including the adversaries the\ncharacters will face. You’ll also ask the players questions\nthat drive the narrative forward. Often, you’ll be the one who\nknows the rules and can answer questions about mechanics\nduring play. If a judgment needs to be made during a session\nabout a rule or mechanic that’s not in the rulebook, you’ll be\nthe one to make that decision.\nAs a GM, it’s important to remember that you’re not an\nantagonistic force against the players. Though you’re the\none introducing the dangers and complications in a scene,\nthe thrilling challenges you provide are meant to let the\nplayers showcase their characters’ strengths and face their\ncharacters’ flaws. Be a fan of the characters and a collaborator\nwith the other players at your table.\nGAME DICE\nDaggerheart uses the full suite of polyhedral dice: d4, d6, d8,\nd10, d12, d20, and d100. When referring to a quantity of dice\nbeyond a single die, the game indicates how many and which\nkind, such as 2d6 (two six-sided dice) or 3d8 (three eight-sided\ndice). Players will need 2d12 of different colors (your Duality\nDice) and at least one set of polyhedral dice to share amongst\nthe table. You may find it easier for each person to have their\nown set. As your character levels up, you’ll be rolling more\ndice to represent those advancements, so it may be helpful to\nbring another set or two. The GM will also need their own set\nof dice to run adversaries.\nTOKENS\nCharacter tokens are small objects that represent the look and\nfeel of your character. Gather about seven tokens per player to\nstart. You will need more as your character levels up—while\nthe amount varies depending on the character build, you likely\nwon’t need more than fifteen tokens at level 10.\nAs you play the game, you’ll use these tokens to help track\nseveral things:\n• When you roll dice, you’ll add tokens to help\nyou easily count the modifiers on the roll.\n• To use certain features, you might be required to\nplace tokens on the card or character sheet.\nThese tokens not only make your rolls easier to resolve, but\nthey also provide an opportunity to further express the style\nand color palette of your character. You can use any small\nobject (plastic gems, pennies, buttons), but we recommend\nsomething no larger than a quarter that can sit on the table\nwithout rolling away. Ideally, each player’s tokens should be\nvisually distinct to avoid confusion.\nThe GM can use tokens to track their accumulated Fear and as\ncounters on adversary stat blocks.\nGAME CARDS\nAlong with this rulebook, you’ll also need the cards that come\nwith the core set: ancestry, community, subclass, and domain\ncards. If you don’t have a physical set of cards (or need extra\ncopies), you can download and print the cards at home.\nThe “Domain Card Reference” section in the appendix also\ncontains the text for cards from the core set.\nCHARACTER SHEETS AND NOTES\nThe appendix contains a general character sheet and\nthe guides you can use to build your characters, but we\nrecommend using the class-specific character sheets from\nwww.daggerheart.com for the best experience. The remainder\nof this rulebook will assume you’re using the class-specific\nsheets. If you’re using pencil and paper, you’ll want to have\nthese materials printed out. If you’re using a digital version\ninstead, ensure you have a laptop or tablet available to view\nand edit your character sheet and guide during the game.\nWe also recommend paper and writing utensils (or a digital\nequivalent) to record important details that the GM or other\nplayers share.\nOPTIONAL: MAPS AND MINIATURES\nYou can use maps and miniatures to represent the scenarios\nthe players are facing, especially during battle, to more fully\nillustrate the scene, rather than relying on only narration\nand description. When drawing or building a map, the scale,\ndistance, and details won’t always be perfect, and that’s\nokay. The maps and the miniatures should never limit your\nimagination—only provide extra spatial context so everyone\ncan picture the scene clearly.\n8\tIntroduction\n\n-- 9 of 415 --\n\nPlayer Principles\nWe recommend following these principles when\nengaging with Daggerheart as a player\nto get the most out of the system.\n→ Be a fan of your character and their journey.\n→ Spotlight your friends.\n→ Address the characters and address the players.\n→ Build the world together.\n→ Play to find out what happens.\n→ Hold on gently.\nBE A FAN OF YOUR CHARACTER AND\nTHEIR JOURNEY\nFind ways to show off what your character does best and what\nthey do worst. Strive to make interesting choices and learn\nmore about who they are through play. Push your character’s\nstory forward and let them grow with the fiction.\nSPOTLIGHT YOUR FRIENDS\nLook for opportunities to put other characters in the spotlight.\nProvide them openings to do what they do best, ask them for\nhelp and offer yours freely, and prompt them to share more of\ntheir thoughts and feelings.\nADDRESS THE CHARACTERS AND ADDRESS\nTHE PLAYERS\nSpeak to the other characters within the world of the fiction.\nLean on the connections you build together, ask them\nquestions, and create a story using your conversations as\nwell as your actions.\nSpeak to the other players outside of the fiction. Ask them\nwhat their character might do and what they want to see\nhappen in the narrative. As you play, be considerate of their\npreferences and desires.\nBUILD THE WORLD TOGETHER\nIn Daggerheart, every participant is a storyteller, not just the\nGM. Daggerheart is a highly collaborative game and reaches\nits greatest potential when every player (including the GM) is\nworking together. This means actively advocating for the story\nbeats you want to see, offering suggestions to enrich the arcs\nof the other player characters, creating parts of the world with\nothers at the table, and thinking deeply about your character’s\nmotivations.\nPLAY TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS\nEverything you do at the table should flow from the fiction.\nListen to your fellow players and the GM—then react to what\ntheir characters say and do to discover the story together as\nyou build on each other’s creativity. If you roll the dice, let\nthe results lead you through what happens next. Embrace\ncomplications with the same vigor with which you celebrate\nvictories.\nHOLD ON GENTLY\nImprovisational storytelling isn’t always perfect, and that’s\nokay. Hold on gently to the fiction—enough that you don’t\nlose the pieces that matter, but not so tightly that the\nnarrative has no room to breathe. Let yourself make mistakes\nand make changes. Smooth the edges and shape them to fit\nthe story. Even if the story beats don't go the way you expect\nor a sudden twist catches you by surprise, trust that the GM\nand your fellow players will all create something beautiful and\nmemorable by the end.\nFollowing these principles will help guide you in telling\nexciting, unpredictable, and meaningful stories together at\nyour table.\nA Table for All\nDaggerheart is a game for players of all races, ethnicities,\ngenders, faiths, sexualities, and identities. It is the\nresponsibility of each player in the game to ensure that the\ntable you share is a place where everyone is empowered,\nrespected, and safe.\nBecause of the nature of open-ended storytelling in roleplaying\ngames, it’s possible to touch upon topics that might be\ndifficult or sensitive for some players. Subject matter that\nmight just be an imaginary scenario for you could bring up a\nreal-life topic that is personal or uncomfortable for somebody\nelse. When you gather to play for the first time, make sure that\nyou talk through what kind of experience you’re all looking to\nhave, and bring up any themes or topics you’d like to avoid.\nEveryone should abide by this social contract, and add to or\nmodify it at any time as needed.\nThe “Session Zero and Safety Tools” section in chapter 3\npresents resources you can use to help navigate difficult\nscenarios together.\n9\tIntroduction\n\n-- 10 of 415 --\n\n\n\n-- 11 of 415 --\n\nCHAPTER ONE:\nPREPARING FOR ADVENTURE\nIn this chapter, you’ll prepare for your first game of Daggerheart. The upcoming sections describe\nDaggerheart’s worldbuilding fundamentals, then walk you through creating a character while\nproviding information on each of the classes, domains, ancestries, and communities.\nWorld Overview\nDaggerheart encourages the exploration of worlds filled\nwith great magic, wondrous landscapes, mythical beasts,\ndynamic factions, rousing mysteries, and powerful foes.\nWhile the world your table collaboratively creates will be your\nown, Daggerheart has established ancestries, communities,\nclasses, abilities, and spells—so some worldbuiding aspects\nwill exist similarly across every campaign.\nThe following section describes the core realms, where these\nshared details derive from. These details can always be\nreflavored or modified to match the style of game your group\nwants to play. When creating your table’s unique world, you\ncan use one of the following as a starting point: an existing\nlocation you’re already familiar with, a supplemental setting\nbook, the guide for creating your own world in the “Running\na Campaign” section in chapter 3, or a campaign frame from\nchapter 5.\nCORE REALMS\nThe core realms are the basis for the worldbuilding elements\ninherent to many of Daggerheart’s mechanics, such as its\nancestries and adversaries.\nTHE MORTAL REALM\nMost adventures will likely take place in the Mortal Realm.\nThis is the land, sea, and sky, where mortals live out the\nentirety of their lives—the plane where the majority of all\nmaterial beings and objects exist. Stories say this realm was\ncreated by the Forgotten Gods during the Earliest Age and\nthat these immortals traveled between the Hallows Above\nand this new plane as easily as waking from a dream. During\nthis time, the gods were familiar to the mortals and acts of\ndivinity were commonplace—be they wonderful or terrifying.\nWhen the Forgotten Gods were overthrown by the New Gods,\nmany of these ancient deities were trapped within this plane\neternally.\nThis realm is also occupied by the Faint Divinities, lesser\ndeities created by both the Forgotten and the New Gods to\noversee the Mortal Realm. Many are considered to be quite\ncapricious, and though their spheres of influence are smaller\nthan the gods who created them, they can greatly influence\nthe lives of mortals.\nTHE HALLOWS ABOVE\nThe Hallows Above are the collection of deific territories\nthat once belonged to the Forgotten Gods before the New\nGods claimed it at the end of the Earliest Age. Because this\nplace is closely connected with most other realms, the gods\nresiding here can see and speak with the creatures of the\nMortal Realm without leaving their domain, though those\nwith whom the gods communicate may find their methods\nstrange or obfuscated. There are ways by which the New\nGods can leave the Hallows Above to occupy other realms,\nbut in the current age they must always sacrifice something\nof personal importance to do so. It’s rumored that this burden\nwas necessitated by their desire to protect the Hallows from\nthe Forgotten Gods should they rise again, as the Forgotten\nGods (or any being from the Mortal Realm) would also have to\nforfeit much to enter the Hallows Above. These sacrifices have\ncaused some of the great calamities that have befallen the\nMortal Realm in recent millenia.\nTHE CIRCLES BELOW\nThe Circles Below are the collection of lower realms where\nmany of the Forgotten Gods, those who fought the most\npassionately during the uprising, were banished. Known as\n“the Fallen Gods,” these deities lost the Divine War with\nthe New Gods during the Earliest Age and have since been\ndeemed “evil practitioners of tainted magic.” Thus the Faint\nDivinities who were banished alongside them are commonly\nreferred to as “demons,” and those that descended from these\ncreatures also bear the weight of that identifier.\nThe Circles Below are considered places of corruption,\ndestruction, and violence. Stories say this dominion is home\nto some of the most dangerous creatures in the core realms.\nMost other planes have safeguards against Fallen who wish\nto cross from the Circles Below. Within the Mortal Realm,\nthe use of arcane magic in acts of great evil is said to open a\ntemporary rift between the two planes, allowing Fallen to pass\nthrough.\nTHE REALMS BEYOND\nThe cosmos holds many realms beyond these—the Elemental\nLands, the Astral Realm, the Valley of Death, and countless\nothers. Accessing and traversing these places from the Mortal\nRealm requires specialized knowledge and hard-learned\nskills. Still, some of the beings in the core realms guard these\nsecrets closely and could be persuaded to share them—for\na price.\n11\tChapter 1: Preparing for Adventure\n\n-- 12 of 415 --\n\nMAGIC AND SPELLS\nDepending on the kind of character you play, they may or may\nnot have the ability to use magic. Magic in Daggerheart is both\nvery powerful and incredibly dangerous, permeating the land\nand manifesting within the people. It is both a force within you\nthat can aid you throughout your journey and a force outside\nof you that affects the world.\nIf your character does have the power of spellcasting, you’ll\nuse magic through specific weapons, spells, and other means.\nAs characters grow, the magic they can perform grows with\nthem. Each level, you gain cards that describe the new,\npowerful magic they can wield and the specific parameters\nfor using it.\nFLAVORING YOUR GAME\nIf the default portrayal of your character’s mechanical effects\ndoesn’t fit them and their style, you can always describe them\nin a way that does. This is often called “flavoring.” However,\nunless your table agrees, that flavor shouldn’t offer any\nmechanical effect beyond the effect’s existing description.\nFor instance, you might say that your rogue’s magic takes the\nform of gadgets and inventions, instead of magically creating\na dark cloud, they drop a smoke grenade. Or perhaps your\nranger’s magic takes the form of ancestral spirits who draw\nforth the forces of nature. Perhaps magic works in an entirely\ndifferent way in your lore, and you explain how every class’s\npower emerges from a different source. As long as it abides by\nthe mechanics of the game, you’re encouraged to flavor your\nmagic to suit your character.\nYou can reflavor items, as well. Your character might have a\nunique weapon from their heritage, but it uses the statistics\nof a longsword. Your wizard’s armor might come in the form\nof a set of empowered runes instead of chainmail, but they\nstill have Armor Slots you can spend to reduce damage. In\nthis case, “repairing” your armor during a rest could mean\nreplenishing the enchantment. The “Adjusting Abilities and\nSpells” section of this chapter suggests other ways you\ncan tailor your spells and abilities to fit your character and\ncomfort level.\n12 \tChapter 1: World Overview\n\n-- 13 of 415 --\n\nCharacter Creation\nUnless you’re the GM, the first step of Daggerheart is to create your character. In addition to\nchoosing their class, community, and ancestry, you’re also responsible for crafting their physical\nappearance, personality, and prior experience, as well as their relationships with the other\ncharacters. Some of these decisions are purely narrative, meaning they only appear in the game\nthrough your roleplaying, but others are mechanical choices that affect the actions you’re more\n(or less) likely to succeed at when rolling your dice.\nGETTING STARTED\nBefore you create your character, discuss the campaign with your table and begin brainstorming ideas.\nTip: There are many mechanics mentioned in the Character Creation section that will be fully covered in chapter 2.\nHAVE A SESSION ZERO\nIf you’re preparing to start a new campaign with your group,\nwe recommend that you use your first session together to\nbuild characters and talk about the world you’ll be playing\nin. This is often called a session zero (see the “Session Zero\nand Safety Tools” section on page 169) and is the best way to\nensure that everyone is on the same page about the tone and\nfeel of the campaign so you can create characters who work\nwell together.\nTHINK ABOUT CHARACTER CONCEPTS\nBefore you begin the character-building process, it can be\nhelpful to review the materials and formulate an idea for\nwhat type of character you want to play. Your concept can be\nsurface-level and general—such as “a circus performer who\nuses magic” or “a captain who lost their ship at sea”—but\nhaving even a basic starting point will help you make choices\nas you move through each of the following step.\nSTEP 1:\nCHOOSE YOUR CLASS\nThe first step of character creation is to choose the class you want to play. Each class is a role-based archetype that determines\nwhat abilities you have access to throughout the campaign. For example, you might choose to play a guardian if you want to be\nthe “tank” of your group who runs into fights headfirst and protects others with their own life. You might choose to be a wizard if\nyou want to cast unique spells to solve problems, heal party members, and wield cunning battle magic.\nOnce you’ve chosen a class, you’ll also choose a subclass.\nThe subclasses are subsets of each class that further define\nyour character’s archetype.\n13\tChapter 1: Character Creation\n\n-- 14 of 415 --\n\nCLASS OPTIONS\nThe following classes and subclasses are available in the core rulebook:\nBARD\nSubclasses: Troubadour or Wordsmith\nDRUID\nSubclasses: Warden of the Elements or Warden of Renewal\nGUARDIAN\nSubclasses: Stalwart or Vengeance\nRANGER\nSubclasses: Beastbound or Wayfinder\nPlay the Troubadour\nif you want to play music\nto bolster your allies.\nPlay the Wordsmith\nif you want to use clever\nwordplay and captivate crowds.\nPlay the Warden\nof the Elements\nif you want to embody\nthe natural elements\nof the wild.\nPlay the Warden\nof Renewal\nif you want to use powerful\nmagic to heal your party.\nPlay the Stalwart\nif you want to take heavy\nblows and keep fi ghting.\nPlay the Vengeance\nif you want to strike down\nenemies who harm you\nor your allies.\nPlay the Beastbound\nif you want to form a deep\nbond with an animal ally.\nPlay the Wayfinder\nif you want to hunt your prey\nand strike with deadly force.\n14 \tChapter 1: Character Creation\n\n-- 15 of 415 --\n\nROGUE\nSubclasses: Nightwalker or Syndicate\nSERAPH\nSubclasses: Divine Wielder or Winged Sentinel\nSORCERER\nSubclasses: Elemental Origin or Primal Origin\nWARRIOR\nSubclasses: Call of the Brave or Call of the Slayer\nWIZARD\nSubclasses: School of Knowledge or School of War\nPlay the Nightwalker\nif you want to manipulate\nshadows to maneuver\nthrough the environment.\nPlay the Syndicate\nif you want to have a web of\ncontacts everywhere you go.\nPlay the Winged Sentinel\nif you want to take fl ight\nand strike crushing blows\nfrom the sky.\nPlay the Divine Wielder\nif you want to dominate\nthe battlefield with a\nlegendary weapon.\nPlay the Call of the Slayer\nsubclass if you want to strike\ndown adversaries with immense\nforce .\nPlay the Call of the Brave\nif you want to use the might\nof your enemies to fuel\nyour own power.\nPlay the Call of the Slayer\nif you want to strike\ndown adversaries with\nimmense force.\nPlay the Elemental Origin\nif you want to channel\nthe raw power of a\nparticular element.\nPlay the Primal Origin\nif you want to extend the\nversatility of your spells\nin powerful ways.\nPlay the School of Knowledge\nif you want a keen\nunderstanding of the\nworld around you.\nPlay the School of War\nif you want to\nutilize trained magic\nfor violence.\nYou can learn more about these classes in the upcoming “Class” section.\n15\tChapter 1: Character Creation\n\n-- 16 of 415 --\n\nCHARACTER SHEET, CHARACTER GUIDE,\nAND SUBCLASS CARD\nOnce you’ve chosen your class, grab the corresponding\ncharacter sheet and character guide, then decide on a\nsubclass and take that subclass’s foundation card. The\ncharacter sheet is for recording your character’s details,\nso make sure you have paper or digital copies available. If\nyou’re filling out a hard copy, use a pencil, as you’ll change\ndetails on the sheet as your character levels up. You can\nfind a completed character sheet in the upcoming “Example\nCharacter” section.\nCustomized character sheets and character guides are\navailable for download at www.daggerheart.com. A general\ncharacter sheet is also available in the appendix.\nRECORD YOUR LEVEL\nCharacters in Daggerheart start at level 1. Record your level\nin the appropriate section at the top of your character sheet,\nand make sure to change it every time you level up. We\nrecommend starting your campaign at level 1, but a more\nexperienced table can start at a higher level if the GM and\nplayers prefer.\nRECORD CHARACTER DETAILS\nAt any point in the character creation process, feel free\nto fill out your character’s name and pronouns on the top\nline, as well as the Character Description details on the\ncharacter guide. For some people, their character’s name\nand appearance come first, and for others, it takes time\nto discover what’s right. As long as you have a name and\ndescription by the time your table is finished with character\ncreation, it doesn’t matter what order you complete these\nsteps in.\nCLASS FEATURE\nEvery class begins with a unique class feature (or several).\nYou don’t have to write these features down—they’re\nprovided at the bottom left of each class’s character sheet.\nThese are features available only to your class. If your class\nfeature asks you to make a selection during character\ncreation, make it before your first session.\nSTEP 2:\nCHOOSE YOUR HERITAGE\nNext, choose your character’s heritage. This aspect of your\ncharacter includes two elements—their ancestry and their\ncommunity.\nCHOOSE YOUR ANCESTRY\nA character’s ancestry reflects their lineage, impacting their\nphysicality and granting them two unique features. Take the\ncard for one of the following ancestries, then write its name in\nthe Heritage field of your character sheet:\nClank \tFirbolg \tHuman\nDrakona \tFungril \tInfernis\nDwarf \tGalapa \tKatari\nElf \tGiant \tOrc\nFaerie \tGoblin \tRibbet\nFaun \tHalfling \tSimiah\nYou can learn more about these ancestries in the upcoming\n“Ancestry” section.\nCHOOSE YOUR COMMUNITY\nNext, you’ll choose a community from the available\ncommunity cards. Your character’s community is influenced\nby its physical location, values, and goals. It informs the\nculture your character grew up in and might play a part in the\nway they look, act, or approach situations. Each community\ncomes with a feature that you can utilize during the game.\nTake the card for one of the following communities, then write\nits name in the Heritage field of your character sheet:\nHighborne \tRidgeborne \tUnderborne\nLoreborne \tSeaborne \tWanderborne\nOrderborne \tSlyborne \tWildborne\nYou can learn more about these communities in the\nupcoming “Community” section.\nLANGUAGES\nIn Daggerheart, you’re not asked to pick specific languages\nfor your character. This game assumes that everyone speaks\na common language (it’s up to you whether that’s through\nmundane or magical means) and that sign language is widely\nunderstood across cultures and communities. If you’d like to\nhave specific regional languages in your campaign, discuss\noptions with your table.\n16 \tChapter 1: Character Creation\n\n-- 17 of 415 --\n\nSTEP 3:\nASSIGN CHARACTER TRAITS\nNext, you’ll assign values to the character traits on your\ncharacter sheet. These values reflect your natural or trained\nability in each of the core six stats: Agility, Strength, Finesse,\nInstinct, Presence, and Knowledge. Each trait lists verbs (such\nas Sprint, Leap, and Maneuver) that show the types of actions\na character might perform that involve that trait. These\nexamples are just inspiration—they shouldn’t limit how each\ntrait can be used.\nAGILITY: Sprint, Leap, Maneuver\nA high Agility means you’re fast on your feet, nimble on\ndifficult terrain, and quick to react to danger. You’ll make\nan Agility Roll to scurry up a rope, sprint to cover, or bound\nfrom rooftop to rooftop.\nSTRENGTH: Lift, Smash, Grapple\nA high Strength means you’re better at feats that test your\nphysical prowess and stamina. You’ll make a Strength Roll\nto break through a door, lift heavy objects, or hold your\nground against a charging foe.\nFINESSE: Control, Hide, Tinker\nA high Finesse means you’re skilled at tasks that require\naccuracy, stealth, or the utmost control. You’ll make a\nFinesse Roll to use fine tools, escape notice, or strike with\nprecision.\nINSTINCT: Perceive, Sense, Navigate\nA high Instinct means you have a keen sense of your\nsurroundings and a natural intuition. You’ll make an Instinct\nRoll to sense danger, notice details in the world around you,\nor track an elusive foe.\nPRESENCE: Charm, Perform, Deceive\nA high Presence means you have a strong force of\npersonality and a facility for social situations. You’ll make\na Presence Roll to plead your case, intimidate a foe, or\ncapture the attention of a crowd.\nKNOWLEDGE: Recall, Analyze, Comprehend\nA high Knowledge means you know information others\ndon’t and understand how to apply your mind through\ndeduction and inference. You’ll make a Knowledge Roll\nto interpret facts, see the patterns clearly, or remember\nimportant information.\nDISTRIBUTE TRAIT MODIFIERS\nTrait modifiers are the values associated with each trait.\nWhen you make an action roll using one of these traits, that\ntrait’s modifier is added to the roll to determine the final result\n(or subtracted from the roll for a negative modifier).\nDistribute the following starting modifiers across your\ncharacter’s traits in any order you wish:\n+2, +1, +1, 0, 0, −1.\nWhen distributing these modifiers, consider what actions\nyou want your character to be good at, what weapon you\nwant to use for your attacks, and what kind of spellcasting\nyou’ll be doing, if any. Weapons and spells are covered in\nfuture sections, but the character guide for your class offers\nsuggested placement for your modifiers if you want a starting\npoint. You can also rearrange your modifiers as needed during\ncharacter creation, as well as after your first few sessions of\nplay.\nIf you ever need to refer to your trait modifiers as values (if\na card or effect references your Agility, Presence, etc.) a +2\nwould be considered 2, and a −1 would still be considered −1.\nFor example, if a domain card tells you to place a number of\ntokens equal to your character’s Knowledge on that card, and\ntheir Knowledge is +3, you would place 3 tokens on the card.\nIf they have a negative modifier in that trait, you instead would\nplace no tokens on the card (unless otherwise noted).\n17\tChapter 1: Character Creation\n\n-- 18 of 415 --\n\nSTEP 4:\nRECORD ADDITIONAL\nCHARACTER INFORMATION\nIt’s time to take a quick break from making choices and\ninstead fill out a few sections of your character sheet.\nEVASION\nYour character’s Evasion reflects how hard it is for\nadversaries to hit them. Your class’s starting Evasion appears\nright beneath the Evasion field on your character sheet; copy\nthis number into the Evasion field. When an adversary makes\nan attack against your character, the GM rolls against their\nEvasion to see if the adversary succeeds. You can choose how\nyour character’s Evasion manifests within the narrative—a\nwizard might avoid blows with shimmering arcane shields or\nbat away an adversary’s spells, while a ranger nimbly dodges\nout of the way of attacks and a warrior parries, blocks, and\ndodges.\nYour character’s Evasion starts low, but that’s because\nit’s not their only means of avoiding damage. If they’re hit,\nyou’ll also have the opportunity to reduce the incoming\ndamage using armor.\nHIT POINTS AND STRESS\nYour character’s health and well-being are represented by Hit\nPoints and Stress. Hit Points (sometimes called HP) are an\nabstract reflection of your physical fortitude and ability to take\nhits from both blade and magic. Each class starts with a set\nnumber of Hit Points. Stress reflects your ability to withstand\nthe pressures of dangerous situations and mental strain. Every\nclass starts with 6 Stress.\nYou can describe your character’s Hit Points and Stress any\nway you wish, but they generally represent your character’s\nability to get knocked down and keep coming back. You’ll mark\nyour character’s Hit Points and Stress when these situations\narise—and the fewer marks you have, the better.\nHOPE AND FEAR\nHope and Fear are currencies used by the players and the GM\nto represent the way fate turns for or against the characters\nduring the game. You start with 2 Hope; mark these in the\nHope field of your character sheet.\nAny time you roll with Hope on your Duality Dice—meaning\nyour Hope Die rolled higher than your Fear Die—you gain\na Hope (to a maximum of 6). During the game, you can\nspend Hope to help your character’s allies, apply their life\nexperiences to challenges, and empower their spells\nand abilities.\nIf you instead roll with Fear on your Duality Dice—meaning\nyour Fear Die rolled higher than your Hope Die—the GM gains\na Fear that they can spend on certain effects. Sometimes a\nFear roll introduces other complications into a scene (even if\nyou succeed on your roll).\nSTEP 5:\nCHOOSE YOUR STARTING\nEQUIPMENT\nNext, you’ll choose starting weapons, armor, and other items\nfor your character.\nCHOOSE YOUR WEAPONS\nYou use physical weapons to attack your foes—and if you\nhave a Spellcast trait (such as from your subclass), you can\nalso wield magic weapons. At character creation, you can\nchoose either a two-handed primary weapon, or a one-handed\nprimary weapon and a one-handed secondary weapon, then\nequip them.\nYou can find weapon suggestions at the top of your character\nguide, but if you’d like to choose your own, you can find all\nstarting (Tier 1) weapons in the “Primary Weapon Tables” and\n“Secondary Weapon Tables” sections in chapter 2. (These\nare also available as a separate sheet to print out from the\nDaggerheart website or in the appendix.)\nAt Level 1, your Proficiency is 1. This means you’ll roll one\ndamage die for your weapon attacks. In the Active Weapons\narea of your character sheet, this is recorded in the Proficiency\nfield.\nTip: In the area of your character labeled Damage Dice &\nType, record your damage dice with the Proficiency value\nalready written in (like “1d6+3” instead of “d6+3”), to\nremind yourself how many weapon dice to roll. Whenever\nyou increase your Proficiency, you also increase the number\nof dice in the damage dice field to reflect this change. For\nexample, when your Proficiency becomes 2, you would\nchange it to \"2d6+3\" instead.\nCHOOSE YOUR ARMOR\nYou use armor to reduce the severity of incoming attacks. At\ncharacter creation, you can choose one set of armor and equip\nit. You can find armor suggestions at the top of your character\nguide, but if you’d like to choose your own, you can find all\nstarting (Tier 1) armor in the “Armor Tables” section in chapter\n2. (These are also available as a separate sheet to print out\nfrom the Daggerheart website or in the appendix.) When your\ncharacter equips armor, record its details in the Active Armor\nfields of your character sheet.\nAn armor’s damage thresholds (shown in the “Base\nThresholds” column) indicate how much damage a character\ncan endure before marking Hit Points. Add your character’s\nlevel to both values and record the total for both numbers\nin the corresponding fields. In the “Hit Points and Damage\nThresholds” section of chapter 2, you’ll learn how many\nHit Points to mark on your character sheet each time your\ncharacter takes damage.\n18 \tChapter 1: Character Creation\n\n-- 19 of 415 --\n\nThen, in the Armor field at the top left of your character sheet,\nrecord your Armor Score. This score includes the armor’s\nbase value (shown in the “Base Score” column) plus any\npermanent bonuses your character has to their Armor Score\nfrom other abilities. When your character takes damage, you\ncan mark one of the small shield symbols next to your Armor\nScore (called an Armor Slot), then reduce the severity of the\ndamage by one threshold: Severe to Major, Major to Minor, or\nMinor to None. You can only mark one Armor Slot per attack,\nand you have a number of slots equal to your Armor Score.\nCHOOSE OTHER STARTING ITEMS\nYour inventory includes anything else your character is\ncarrying. The top of your character guide lists all their starting\ninventory items, which include the following:\n• Torch (useful for illuminating a dark room)\n• 50 feet of rope (useful for climbing a\nwall or rappelling down a cliff)\n• Basic supplies (tent, bedroll, tinderbox, rations, etc.)\n• A handful of gold (record this in the Gold field in\nthe left-hand column of your character sheet)\n• Your choice of a Minor Health Potion (clear 1d4 Hit\nPoints) or a Minor Stamina Potion (clear 1d4 Stress)\n• The “and either” option on your character guide\nis specific to your class. You might also be asked\nto choose what you use to carry your spells.\nRecord these items in the Inventory fields of your character\nsheet. This equipment is available to use during the party’s\nadventures in any way that fits the shared story. We\nencourage you to use items creatively, as long as the GM\nagrees and it fits the rules of the world.\nYou can also talk to your GM about other items you’d like\nto have at the start of the game. There are no rules limiting\nthe size of your inventory, so items that don’t provide a\nmechanical benefit but make sense for your character to have\nare normally okay—but your GM always makes the final call.\nSTEP 6:\nCREATE YOUR BACKGROUND\nNext, explore your character’s background by answering\nthe background questions in your character guide. Several\nprompts are provided to jumpstart inspiration, but you or the\nGM can modify or replace these questions to fit the character\nyou’re looking to play. The prompts are a jumping-off point if\nyou don’t know where to start, but they should never inhibit\nyour creativity.\nThe decisions you make about your character’s background\nare purely narrative, but they deeply impact the character\nyou’re playing and the story the GM is preparing for your\nadventures. Over the course of character creation, feel free to\nadjust mechanical choices you made in earlier steps to better\nreflect this background as you shape your character.\nIf you’re planning to play in a campaign, you can continue\ndeveloping your character after the background questions in\nwhatever way works best for you. Just remember to give the\nGM your backstory so they can work any people, places, or\nideas from it into the campaign. You can also choose not to\ndo any more background work, instead finding out more\nabout your character as you play. Lean into a process\nthat’s fun for you.\n19\tChapter 1: Character Creation\n\n-- 20 of 415 --\n\nSTEP 7:\nCREATE YOUR EXPERIENCES\nIn Daggerheart, your character’s Experiences are one of the\ncore ways you express their backstory and expertise through\nmechanics. An Experience is a word or phrase used to\nencapsulate a specific set of skills your character has\nacquired over the course of their exciting life.\nYour character starts with two Experiences at character\ncreation (each with a +2 modifier), and they’ll earn more\nthroughout your adventures. Before creating Experiences,\nyou’ll want to have a solid idea of who your character is; the\nbackground questions are especially helpful for this. When\nyou’re ready, work with your GM to create two Experiences\nthat have shaped your character.\nThere’s no set list of Experiences to choose from (though we\noffer options for inspiration under “Experience Examples”).\nInstead, find a word or phrase that embodies something\ndistinctive about your character. Each Experience should be\nspecific. For example, Talented or Focused are too broad,\nas they can be applied to almost any situation; instead you\nmight use Swashbuckler or Magic Studies. Additionally, your\ncharacter’s Experience can’t give them spells or specific\ngame abilities. For example, Take Flight or One-Hit Kill are too\nmechanically oriented; you might consider Pilot or Assassin\ninstead.\nYou are also encouraged to add flavor to your character’s\nExperience to give it more varied use in play. For example,\ninstead of just Assassin, you could choose Assassin of the\nSapphire Syndicate. Details like this give your GM an exciting\nfaction to weave into the campaign, and also make it easier\nto use this Experience outside combat. For example, if your\ncharacter encounters an ally of the syndicate, they might be\nparticularly adept at negotiating with that NPC based on their\nExperience.\nOnce you’ve decided on your character’s two starting\nExperiences, record them in the Experience fields of your\ncharacter sheet and assign +2 to both.\nTip: If you’re not sure what Experiences to take, consider the\nstyle of the campaign you’re playing in and the actions you’ll\nwant to perform. In a standard, battle-focused campaign,\nit’s never a bad idea to take your character’s first Experience\nin something that will help with combat and the second\nExperience in something useful outside of combat.\nEXPERIENCE EXAMPLES\nBackgrounds: Assassin, Blacksmith, Bodyguard, Bounty\nHunter, Chef to the Royal Family, Circus Performer,\nCon Artist, Fallen Monarch, Field Medic, High Priestess,\nMerchant, Noble, Pirate, Politician, Runaway, Scholar,\nSellsword, Soldier, Storyteller, Thief, World Traveler\nCharacteristics: Affable, Battle-Hardened, Bookworm,\nCharming, Cowardly, Friend to All, Helpful, Intimidating\nPresence, Leader, Lone Wolf, Loyal, Observant, Prankster,\nSilver Tongue, Sticky Fingers, Stubborn to a Fault, Survivor,\nYoung and Naive\nSpecialties: Acrobat, Gambler, Healer, Inventor, Magical\nHistorian, Mapmaker, Master of Disguise, Navigator,\nSharpshooter, Survivalist, Swashbuckler, Tactician\nSkills: Animal Whisperer, Barter, Deadly Aim, Fast\nLearner, Incredible Strength, Liar, Light Feet, Negotiator,\nPhotographic Memory, Quick Hands, Repair, Scavenger,\nTracker\nPhrases: Catch Me If You Can, Fake It Till You Make It, First\nTime’s the Charm, Hold the Line, I Won’t Let You Down,\nI’ll Catch You, I’ve Got Your Back, Knowledge Is Power,\nNature’s Friend, Never Again, No One Left Behind, Pick on\nSomeone Your Own Size, The Show Must Go On, This Is\nNot a Negotiation, Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing\nUSING EXPERIENCES\nWhen one of your character’s Experiences fits the situation\nat hand, you can use that Experience to showcase their\nexpertise. Before you make an action or reaction roll, you\ncan spend a Hope to add the Experience’s modifier to the\nroll’s result. Sometimes more than one of your character’s\nExperiences is a good fit for the situation (for example, if\nyour character is trying to sneak past a guard in the dark,\nyour I Live in the Shadows and Stealthy Experiences would\nboth apply). If it fits the story, you can add more than one\nexperience modifier to a roll, spending a Hope for each.\nCHANGING EXPERIENCES\nYour character has the opportunity to gain new Experiences as\nthey gain levels. However, if you discover that your character\nhas outgrown a previous Experience or it doesn’t feel right\nanymore, you’re not stuck with the ones you’ve already\nchosen. For example, you might find that your character’s\nStealthy Experience no longer matches the head-on way\nthey’ve learned to solve problems. Or perhaps your group likes\nto try to solve things diplomatically first, so your character’s\nCatch Them by Surprise Experience isn’t a good fit for the\ntable’s collaborative story. That’s totally okay! Work with your\nGM to find Experiences that better align with your storytelling\ngoals, and with the actions your character would be good at.\n20 \tChapter 1: Character Creation\n\n-- 21 of 415 --\n\nSTEP 8:\nCHOOSE YOUR DOMAIN CARDS\nDomains are the core building blocks of Daggerheart’s\nclasses. The following domains are included in this book:\nArcana, Blade, Bone, Codex, Grace, Midnight, Sage, Splendor,\nand Valor. Each domain has a domain deck—a deck of cards\ncontaining abilities and spells with a central theme or focus.\nFor details on what each domain represents and how to use\nyour domain cards, see the upcoming “Domains” section.\nEach class in Daggerheart is formed by combining two of\nthese domains—for example, the warrior class comprises\nBlade and Bone, the druid comprises Arcana and Sage, and\nthe rogue comprises Midnight and Grace. This combination is\nnoted at the top of the character sheet for each class, and the\ncolors and symbols are found on the subclass foundation card.\nTo start, look at all the level 1 cards from your class’s two\ndomains and choose two cards, returning the rest to their\nrespective decks. You can take one from each domain or two\nfrom a single domain, whichever you prefer. These cards grant\nyou special spells and abilities; you’ll choose another card\neach time you level up.\nTip: All domain card text can also be found for reference on\npage 328.\nSHARED DOMAINS\nEach class shares its domains with at least one other class.\nFor example, Blade is shared by the guardian and the warrior,\nSage is shared by the druid and the ranger, and Grace is\nshared by the bard and the rogue. If a fellow player’s class has\nthe same domain as yours, we encourage you to coordinate\nwith them and choose different cards from that domain deck\n(even if your group has multiple copies). This way, each player\nfeels distinct and shines when they bring their unique abilities\nto the story. However, if the GM and players agree, feel free to\nmake an exception. Sharing cards is common when more than\none player chooses the same class or when three (or more)\nplayers share the same domain. As always, it comes down to\nopen communication between the players and the GM. If you\nneed extra copies of a card, you can download and print them\nat home.\nSTEP 9:\nCREATE YOUR CONNECTIONS\nYou’ve almost finished creating your character! Now it’s time\nto forge their connections. These represent the relationships\nand personal history between your character and their fellow\nparty members.\nOnce your group is comfortable with their finished (or almost-\nfinished) PCs, summarize your characters for each other. At\nminimum, share their name, pronouns, character description,\nExperiences, and the answers to the background questions—\nbut feel free to include any details you’d like the other players\nto know.\nThen work together to decide how your characters are\nconnected and how they feel about each other. The\nConnections section of your character guide provides\ninspiration—we recommend you pick at least one question\nto ask another player for their character to answer—but\nyou’re welcome to create new questions. You can always turn\ndown a question or relationship suggested by another player\nif it’s not a good fit or not a relationship you’re interested in\nexploring. While it’s great to create connections with every\ncharacter, it’s perfectly okay if you’re not sure about some of\nthem yet—and you can always discover your relationships\nthrough play. These connections are a starting point to build\non during the game.\nAfter the party’s connections are complete, you’re ready to\nplay! The rest of this chapter contains resources to use when\nbuilding your character, such as information on domains,\nclasses, ancestries, and communities. Chapter 2 then\npresents the rules you’ll use to play Daggerheart.\n21\tChapter 1: Character Creation\n\n-- 22 of 415 --\n\nstrength\tagility \tFINESSE \tInstinct \tknowledge\tpresence\nSprint\nLeap\nManeuver\nLift\nSmash\nGrapple\nControl\nHide\nTinker\nPerceive\nSense\nNavigate\nCharm\nPerform\nDeceive\nRecall\nAnalyze\nComprehend\nhope\nexperience active armor\nDAMAGE & HEALTH\nclass feature\nDaggerheart © Darrington Press 2025\nBAGS\tHANDFULS \tCHEST\ngold\nINVENTORY\nNAME\nFEATURE\nTRAIT & RANGE \tDAMAGE DICE & TYPE\ninventory weapon\nNAME\nFEATURE\nTRAIT & RANGE \tDAMAGE DICE & TYPE\ninventory weapon\nNAME\nFEATURE\nTRAIT & RANGE \tDAMAGE DICE & TYPE\nPRIMARY\nNAME\nFEATURE\nTRAIT & RANGE \tDAMAGE DICE & TYPE\nsecondary\nNAME\nFEATURE\nBASE THRESHOLDS \tBASE SCORE\nMark 1 HP \tMark 2 HP \tMark 3 HP\nSTRESS\nhp\nMINOR\nDamage\nmajor\nDamage\nsevere\nDamage\nSpend a Hope to use an experience or help an ally.\nname\nheritage\npronouns\nSubclass\narmor\tevasion\nlevel\nPROFICIENCY\nactive weapons\nAdd your current level to your damage thresholds.\nPRIMARY \tSECONDARY\nPRIMARY \tSECONDARY\nStart at 10\nARCANE SENSE\nYou can sense the presence of magical people and objects within\nClose range.\nMINOR ILLUSION\nMake a Spellcast Roll (10).

Slide it beneath your character sheet and pull it out on either the left or right side for guidance.\n23\tChapter 1: Example Character\n\n-- 24 of 415 --\n\nDomains\nDomains are the core themes of each class. The combination of two domains forms the basis for each\nclass’s abilities and spells, which you gain from your domain cards. Near the end of character creation,\nyou’ll pick your first cards from your chosen class’s domains.\nArcana\nArcana is the domain of innate and instinctual\nmagic. Those who choose this path tap into the\nraw, enigmatic forces of the realms to manipulate\nboth their own energy and the elements. Arcana\noffers wielders a volatile power, but it is incredibly\npotent when correctly channeled.\nBlade\nBlade is the domain of weapon mastery. Whether\nby steel, bow, or perhaps a more specialized\narm, those who follow this path have the skill to\ncut short the lives of others. Wielders of Blade\ndedicate themselves to achieving inexorable power\nover death.\nBone\nBone is the domain of tactics and the body.\nPractitioners of this domain have an uncanny\ncontrol over their own physical abilities and an\neye for predicting the behaviors of others in\ncombat. Adherents to Bone gain an unparalleled\nunderstanding of bodies and their movements.\nCodex\nCodex is the domain of intensive magical study.\nThose who seek magical knowledge turn to the\nequations of power recorded in books, written\non scrolls, etched into walls, or tattooed on\nbodies. Codex offers a commanding and versatile\nunderstanding of magic to devotees who pursue\nknowledge beyond the boundaries of common\nwisdom.\nGrace\nGrace is the domain of charisma. Through\nrapturous storytelling, charming spells, or a\nshroud of lies, those who channel this power\ndefine the realities of their adversaries, bending\nperception to their will. Grace offers its wielders\nraw magnetism and mastery over language.\nMidnight\nMidnight is the domain of shadows and secrecy.\nWhether by clever tricks, deft magic, or the cloak\nof night, those who channel these forces practice\nthe art of obscurity and can uncover sequestered\ntreasures. Midnight offers practitioners the power\nto control and create enigmas.\nSage\nSage is the domain of the natural world. Those who\nwalk this path tap into the unfettered power of\nthe earth and its creatures to unleash raw magic.\nSage grants its adherents the vitality of a blooming\nflower and the ferocity of a ravenous predator.\nSplendor\nSplendor is the domain of life. Through this magic,\nfollowers gain the ability to heal and, to an extent,\ncontrol death. Splendor offers its disciples the\nmagnificent ability to both give and end life.\nValor\nValor is the domain of protection. Whether through\nattack or defense, those who choose this discipline\nchannel formidable strength to protect their allies\nin battle. Valor offers great power to those who\nraise their shields in defense of others.\n24 \tChapter 1: Domains\n\n-- 25 of 415 --\n\n\n\n-- 26 of 415 --\n\nREADING DOMAIN CARDS\nDuring character creation and as your character levels up, you’ll gain increasingly powerful domain cards, which provide\nfeatures you can utilize during your adventures.\nSome domain cards provide moves you can make, such as a unique attack or a spell. Others offer passive effects (which always\napply while you hold that card), new abilities to use during downtime or social encounters, or even one-time benefits.\nEach domain card includes five elements:\n1. Level: The number in the top left of the card indicates the\ncard’s level. You can only choose domain cards of your\nlevel or lower.\n2. Domain: Beneath the card’s level there is a symbol\nindicating its domain. You can only choose cards from your\nclass’s domains.\n3. Recall Cost: The number and lightning bolt in the top right\nof the card shows its Recall Cost. This doesn’t affect you\nat character creation, but once you reach level 5, you’ll\nhave more cards than space in your loadout (your set of\nfive active cards; see the “Loadout and Vault” section on\npage 101). You can normally only move an inactive card\nfrom your vault to your loadout during downtime, but you\ncan mark a number of Stress equal to a card’s Recall Cost\nto swap it immediately.\n4. Type: The card’s type is listed in the center above the\ntitle. There are three types of domain cards: abilities,\nspells, and grimoires. Abilities are typically mundane in\nnature, while spells are magical. Grimoires are unique to\nthe Codex domain and are a collection of smaller spells\nbundled together. Some game mechanics only apply to\ncertain types of cards.\n5. Feature: The text on the bottom half of the card describes\nits feature, including any special rules you need to follow\nwhen you use that card.\n1\n4\n5\n3\n2\n26 \tChapter 1: Domains\n\n-- 27 of 415 --\n\nClass\nThis section details each of Daggerheart’s\nclasses. Your chosen class grants the\nfollowing:\nDomains: Each class lists the two domains that serve\nas the basis for its abilities. You can choose cards from\nthese domain decks during character creation and when\nleveling up.\nStarting Evasion: Each class has its own starting Evasion.\nStarting Hit Points: Each class has its own amount of\nstarting Hit Points.\nClass Items: Each class has a unique set of starter items.\nClass Feature: Each class has a unique class feature (or set\nof features).\nClass Hope Feature: Each class has a special move they\ncan make by spending 3 Hope.\nYour chosen subclass grants the following:\nSpellcast Trait: If you’re a spellcaster, this is the\ncharacter trait your subclass uses any time you make\na Spellcast Roll.\nFoundation Feature: The foundation feature is the\nunique starting feature that establishes the identity\nand strengths of the subclass.\nSpecialization Feature: The specialization feature\nis a more advanced feature (or set of features) you\ncan gain when you level up. For some subclasses, the\nspecialization feature is a new ability; for others, it\nexpands the abilities of the class or foundation feature,\nmaking it even more potent.\nMastery Feature: The mastery feature is your\nsubclass’s most powerful feature, which you can gain\nat higher levels. For some subclasses, the mastery\nfeature unlocks an extraordinary new ability; for\nothers, it’s the impressive culmination of their\nsubclass’s core feature.\nThe foundation, specialization, and mastery\nfeatures each come with a card that you can\nchoose to take as one of the benefits from\nleveling up. The cards hold information\nabout the feature for quick reference.\nThe following class sections refer to many\nmechanics and terms that will be taught\nthroughout chapter 2. Use the index to\nnavigate to these concepts as needed.\n27\tChapter 1: Class\n\n-- 28 of 415 --\n\nBARD\nBards are the most charismatic people in all the realms.\nMembers of this class are masters of captivation and specialize in\na variety of performance types, including singing, playing musical\ninstruments, weaving tales, or telling jokes. Whether performing\nfor an audience or speaking to an individual, bards thrive in social\nsituations. Members of this profession bond and train at schools\nor guilds, but a current of egotism runs through those of the\nbardic persuasion. While they may be the most likely class to\nbring people together, a bard of ill temper can just as easily\ntear a party apart.\nDOMAINS\nGrace and Codex\nSTARTING EVASION SCORE\n10\nSTARTING HIT POINTS\n5\nCLASS ITEMS\nA romance novel or a letter never opened\nBARD’S HOPE FEATURE\nMake a Scene: Spend 3 Hope to temporarily Distract a target\nwithin Close range, giving them a -2 penalty to their Difficulty.\nCLASS FEATURE\nRally\nOnce per session, describe how you rally the party and give\nyourself and each of your allies a Rally Die. At level 1, your\nRally Die is a d6. A PC can spend their Rally Die to roll it,\nadding the result to their action roll, reaction roll, damage roll,\nor to clear a number of Stress equal to the result. At the end of\neach session, clear all unspent Rally Dice.\nAt level 5, your Rally Die increases to a d8.\nBARD SUBCLASSES\nChoose either the Troubadour\nor Wordsmith subclass.\nTROUBADOUR\nPlay the Troubadour if you want to play music to\nbolster your allies.\nSPELLCAST TRAIT\nPresence\nFOUNDATION FEATURE\nGifted Performer: Describe how you perform for others. You\ncan play each song once per long rest:\n• Relaxing Song: You and all allies within\nClose range clear a Hit Point.\n• Epic Song: Make a target within Close\nrange temporarily Vulnerable.\n• Heartbreaking Song: You and all allies\nwithin Close range gain a Hope.\nSPECIALIZATION FEATURE\nMaestro: Your rallying songs steel the courage of those who\nlisten. When you give a Rally Die to an ally, they can gain a\nHope or clear a Stress.\nMASTERY FEATURE\nVirtuoso: You are among the greatest of your craft and your\nskill is boundless. You can perform each of your “Gifted\nPerformer” feature’s songs twice instead of once per long rest.\n28 \tChapter 1: Class\n\n-- 29 of 415 --\n\nWORDSMITH\nPlay the Wordsmith if you want to use clever wordplay and\ncaptivate crowds.\nSPELLCAST TRAIT\nPresence\nFOUNDATION FEATURES\nRousing Speech: Once per long rest, you can give a heartfelt,\ninspiring speech. All allies within Far range clear 2 Stress.\nHeart of a Poet: After you make an action roll to impress,\npersuade, or offend someone, you can spend a Hope to add a\nd4 to the roll.\nSPECIALIZATION FEATURE\nEloquent: Your moving words boost morale. Once per session,\nwhen you encourage an ally, you can do one of the following:\n• Allow them to find a mundane object or tool they need.\n• Help an Ally without spending Hope.\n• Give them an additional downtime move during their\nnext rest.\nMASTERY FEATURE\nEpic Poetry: Your Rally Die increases to a d10. Additionally,\nwhen you Help an Ally, you can narrate the moment as if you\nwere writing the tale of their heroism in a memoir. When you\ndo, roll a d10 as your advantage die.\nBACKGROUND QUESTIONS\nAnswer any of the following background questions. You can\nalso create your own questions.\n• Who from your community taught you to have such\nconfidence in yourself?\n• You were in love once. Who did you adore, and how\ndid they hurt you?\n• You’ve always looked up to another bard. Who are\nthey, and why do you idolize them?\nCONNECTIONS\nAsk your fellow players one of the following questions for\ntheir character to answer, or create your own questions.\n• What made you realize we were going to be such\ngood friends?\n• What do I do that annoys you?\n• Why do you grab my hand at night?\n29\tChapter 1: Class\n\n-- 30 of 415 --\n\nDRUID\nBecoming a druid is more than an occupation; it’s a calling for\nthose who wish to learn from and protect the magic of the\nwilderness. While one might underestimate a gentle druid who\npractices the often-quiet work of cultivating flora, druids who\nchannel the untamed forces of nature are terrifying to behold.\nDruids cultivate their abilities in small groups, often connected\nby a specific ethos or locale, but some choose to work alone.\nThrough years of study and dedication, druids can learn to\ntransform into beasts and shape nature itself.\nDOMAINS\nSage and Arcana\nSTARTING EVASION\n10\nSTARTING HIT POINTS\n6\nCLASS ITEMS\nA small bag of rocks and bones or a strange pendant found in\nthe dirt\nDRUID’S HOPE FEATURE\nEvolution: Spend 3 Hope to transform into a Beastform\nwithout marking a Stress. When you do, choose one trait to\nraise by +1 until you drop out of that Beastform.\nCLASS FEATURES\nBeastform\nMark a Stress to magically transform into a creature of your\ntier or lower from the Beastform list. You can drop out of this\nform at any time. While transformed, you can’t use weapons\nor cast spells from domain cards, but you can still use other\nfeatures or abilities you have access to. Spells you cast before\nyou transform stay active and last for their normal duration,\nand you can talk and communicate as normal. Additionally,\nyou gain the Beastform’s features, add their Evasion bonus\nto your Evasion, and use the trait specified in their statistics\nfor your attack. While you’re in a Beastform, your armor\nbecomes part of your body and you mark Armor Slots as\nusual; when you drop out of a Beastform, those marked Armor\nSlots remain marked. If you mark your last Hit Point, you\nautomatically drop out of this form.\nWildtouch\nYou can perform harmless, subtle effects that involve\nnature—such as causing a flower to rapidly grow, summoning\na slight gust of wind, or starting a campfire—at will.\nDRUID SUBCLASSES\nChoose either the Warden of the Elements\nor Warden of Renewal subclass.\nWARDEN OF THE ELEMENTS\nPlay the Warden of the Elements if you want to embody the\nnatural elements of the wild.\nSPELLCAST TRAIT\nInstinct\nFOUNDATION FEATURE\nElemental Incarnation: Mark a Stress to Channel one of the\nfollowing elements until you take Severe damage or until your\nnext rest:\n• Fire: When an adversary within Melee range deals\ndamage to you, they take 1d10 magic damage.\n• Earth: Gain a bonus to your damage\nthresholds equal to your Proficiency.\n• Water: When you deal damage to an adversary\nwithin Melee range, all other adversaries within\nVery Close range must mark a Stress.\n• Air: You can hover, gaining advantage on Agility Rolls.\nSPECIALIZATION FEATURE\nElemental Aura: Once per rest while Channeling, you can\nassume an aura matching your element. The aura affects\ntargets within Close range until your Channeling ends.\n• Fire: When an adversary marks 1 or more Hit\nPoints, they must also mark a Stress.\n• Earth: Your allies gain a +1 bonus to Strength.\n• Water: When an adversary deals damage to you,\nyou can mark a Stress to move them anywhere\nwithin Very Close range of where they are.\n• Air: When you or an ally takes damage from an attack\nbeyond Melee range, reduce the damage by 1d8.\nMASTERY FEATURE\nElemental Dominion: You further embody your element. While\nChanneling, you gain the following benefit:\n• Fire: You gain a +1 bonus to your Proficiency\nfor attacks and spells that deal damage.\n• Earth: When you would mark Hit Points, roll a d6\nper Hit Point marked. For each result of 6, reduce\nthe number of Hit Points you mark by 1.\n• Water: When an attack against you succeeds, you can\nmark a Stress to make the attacker temporarily Vulnerable.\n• Air: You gain a +1 bonus to your Evasion and can fly.\n30 \tChapter 1: Class\n\n-- 31 of 415 --\n\nWARDEN OF RENEWAL\nPlay the Warden of Renewal if you want to use powerful magic\nto heal your party.\nSPELLCAST TRAIT\nInstinct\nFOUNDATION FEATURES\nClarity of Nature: Once per long rest, you can create a space\nof natural serenity within Close range. When you spend a few\nminutes resting within the space, clear Stress equal to your\nInstinct, distributed as you choose between you and your\nallies.\nRegeneration: Touch a creature and spend 3 Hope. That\ncreature clears 1d4 Hit Points.\nSPECIALIZATION FEATURES\nRegenerative Reach: You can target creatures within Very\nClose range with your “Regeneration” feature.\nWarden’s Protection: Once per long rest, spend 2 Hope to\nclear 2 Hit Points on 1d4 allies within Close range.\nMASTERY FEATURE\nDefender: Your animal transformation embodies a healing\nguardian spirit. When you’re in Beastform and an ally within\nClose range marks 2 or more Hit Points, you can mark a\nStress to reduce the number of Hit Points they mark by 1.\nBACKGROUND QUESTIONS\nAnswer any of the following background questions. You can\nalso create your own questions.\n• Why was the community you grew up in so reliant on\nnature and its creatures?\n• Who was the first wild animal you bonded with? Why\ndid your bond end?\n• Who has been trying to hunt you down? What do they\nwant from you?\nCONNECTIONS\nAsk your fellow players one of the following questions for\ntheir character to answer, or create your own questions.\n• What did you confide in me that makes me leap into\ndanger for you every time?\n• What animal do I say you remind me of?\n• What affectionate nickname have you given me?\n31\tChapter 1: Class\n\n-- 32 of 415 --\n\nBEASTFORM OPTIONS\nWhen you use your “Beastform” feature, choose a creature category of your tier or lower. At the GM’s discretion, you can\ndescribe yourself transforming into any animal that reasonably fits into that category.\nBeastform categories are divided by tier. Each entry includes the following details:\n• Creature Category: Each category’s name describes\nthe common role or behavior of creatures in that\ncategory (such as Agile Scout). This name is followed\nby a few examples of animals that fit in that category\n(in this example, fox, mouse, and weasel).\n• Character Trait: While transformed, you gain a bonus\nto the listed trait. For example, while transformed\ninto an Agile Scout, you gain a +1 bonus to your\nAgility. When this form drops, you lose this bonus.\n• Attack Rolls: When you make an attack while\ntransformed, you use the creature’s listed range, trait,\nand damage dice, but you use your Proficiency. For\nexample, as an Agile Scout, you can attack a target\nwithin Melee range using your Agility. On a success,\nyou deal d4 physical damage using your Proficiency.\n• Evasion: While transformed, you add the creature’s\nEvasion bonus to your normal Evasion. For example, if your\nEvasion is usually 8 and your Beastform says “Evasion\n+2,” your Evasion becomes 10 while you’re in that form.\n• Advantages: Your form makes you especially\nsuited to certain actions. When you make an action\nor reaction roll related to one of the verbs listed\nfor that creature category, you gain advantage\non that roll.

Some seraphs\nally themselves with an army or locale, much to the satisfaction\nof their rulers, but other crusaders fight in opposition to the\nfollies of the Mortal Realm.

A sorcerer’s abilities\ncan range from the elemental to the illusionary and beyond, and\nmany practitioners band together into collectives based on their\ntalents.

That said, you can decide that your character possesses\ncharacteristics that aren’t “standard” or “average” for that ancestry. We encourage you to look\nto the art for inspiration and explore the diversity within individual ancestries as you craft your\ncharacter’s appearance.\nWe hope this section provides a window into the various\nphysicalities of the creatures that populate Daggerheart.\nAs you play and meet members of each ancestry, you’ll\nhave the opportunity to learn about the nuances and unique\nqualities among them. You’ll also notice that within the world\nof Daggerheart, the term “people” is used to refer to all\nancestries, as individuals from all lineages possess unique\ncharacteristics and cultures, as well as personhood.\nSome ancestries are described using the term “humanoid.”\nThis does not refer to that specific ancestry having\nany relation to “humans,” the distinct ancestry within\nDaggerheart. Specifically, it refers to the set of physical\ncharacteristics readers will recognize from their own\nanatomy, such as bipedal movement, upright posture,\nfacial layout, and more. These traits vary by ancestry and\nindividual, though “humanoid” should still provide a useful\nframe of reference.\nEach ancestry has two ancestry features. While some\nfeatures (such as the ability to fly) are directly tied to an\nancestry’s anatomy, you ultimately get to determine your\ncharacter’s physical form. If you decide that your faerie\ncharacter never had wings or lost theirs, you can work with\nthe GM to replace the “Wings” feature that grants faeries\nflight. It’s likewise up to you to decide how important your\ncharacter’s appearance is to their story.\nIf you’d like to make a character who combines more than one\nancestry, see the “Mixed Ancestry” section on page 71.\n52 \tChapter 1: Ancestry\n\n-- 53 of 415 --\n\nCLANK\nClanks are sentient mechanical beings built from a variety\nof materials, including metal, wood, and stone. They can\nresemble humanoids, animals, or even inanimate objects. Like\norganic beings, their bodies come in a wide array of sizes.\nBecause of their bespoke construction, many clanks have\nhighly specialized physical configurations. Examples include\nclawed hands for grasping, wheels for movement, or built-in\nweaponry.\nMany clanks embrace body modifications for style as well as\nfunction, and members of other ancestries often turn to clank\nartisans to construct customized mobility aids and physical\nadornments. Other ancestries can create clanks, even using\ntheir own physical characteristics as inspiration, but it’s also\ncommon for clanks to build one another. A clank’s lifespan\nextends as long as they’re able to acquire or craft new parts,\nmaking their physical form effectively immortal. That said,\ntheir minds are subject to the effects of time, and deteriorate\nas the magic that powers them loses potency.\nANCESTRY FEATURES\nPurposeful Design: Decide who made you and for what\npurpose. At character creation, choose one of your\nExperiences that best aligns with this purpose and gain a\npermanent +1 bonus to it.\nEfficient: When you take a short rest, you can choose a long\nrest move instead of a short rest move.\n53\tChapter 1: Ancestry\n\n-- 54 of 415 --\n\nDRAKONA\nDrakona resemble wingless dragons in humanoid form and\npossess a powerful elemental breath. All drakona have thick\nscales that provide excellent natural armor against both\nattacks and the forces of nature. They are large in size, ranging\nfrom 5 feet to 7 feet on average, with long sharp teeth. New\nteeth grow throughout a Drakona’s approximately 350-year\nlifespan, so they are never in danger of permanently losing\nan incisor. Unlike their dragon ancestors, drakona don’t\nhave wings and can’t fly without magical aid. Members of\nthis ancestry pass down the element of their breath through\ngenerations, though in rare cases, a drakona’s elemental power\nwill differ from the rest of their family’s.\nANCESTRY FEATURES\nScales: Your scales act as natural protection. When you would\ntake Severe damage, you can mark a Stress to mark 1 fewer\nHit Points.\nElemental Breath: Choose an element for your breath (such\nas electricity, fire, or ice). You can use this breath against a\ntarget or group of targets within Very Close range, treating it\nas an Instinct weapon that deals d8 magic damage using your\nProficiency.\n54 \tChapter 1: Ancestry\n\n-- 55 of 415 --\n\nDWARF\nDwarves are most easily recognized as short humanoids\nwith square frames, dense musculature, and thick hair.\nTheir average height ranges from 4 to 5 ½ feet, and they\nare often broad in proportion to their stature. Their skin and\nnails contain a high amount of keratin, making them naturally\nresilient. This allows dwarves to embed gemstones into their\nbodies and decorate themselves with tattoos or piercings.\nTheir hair grows thickly—usually on their heads, but some\ndwarves have thick hair across their bodies as well. Dwarves\nof all genders can grow facial hair, which they often style in\nelaborate arrangements. Typically, dwarves live up to 250\nyears of age, maintaining their muscle mass well into later life.\nANCESTRY FEATURES\nThick Skin: When you take Minor damage, you can mark 2\nStress instead of marking a Hit Point.\nIncreased Fortitude: Spend 3 Hope to halve incoming physical\ndamage.\n55\tChapter 1: Ancestry\n\n-- 56 of 415 --\n\nELF\nElves are typically tall humanoids with pointed ears and acutely\nattuned senses. Their ears vary in size and pointed shape, and as\nthey age, the tips begin to droop. While elves come in a wide range\nof body types, they are all fairly tall, with heights ranging from\nabout 6 to 6 ½ feet. All elves have the ability to drop into a celestial\ntrance, rather than sleep. This allows them to rest effectively in a\nshort amount of time.\nSome elves possess what is known as a “mystic form,” which\noccurs when an elf has dedicated themself to the study or\nprotection of the natural world so deeply that their physical form\nchanges. These characteristics can include celestial freckles, the\npresence of leaves, vines, or flowers in their hair, eyes that flicker\nlike fire, and more. Sometimes these traits are inherited from\nparents, but if an elf changes their environment or magical focus,\ntheir appearance changes over time. Because elves live for about\n350 years, these traits can shift more than once throughout their\nlifespan.\nANCESTRY FEATURES\nQuick Reactions: Mark a Stress to gain advantage on a reaction roll.\nCelestial Trance: During a rest, you can drop into a trance to choose\nan additional downtime move.\n56 \tChapter 1: Ancestry\n\n-- 57 of 415 --\n\nFAERIE\nFaeries are winged humanoid creatures with insectile features.\nThese characteristics cover a broad spectrum from humanoid\nto insectoid—some possess additional arms, compound eyes,\nlantern organs, chitinous exoskeletons, or stingers. Because of\ntheir close ties to the natural world, they also frequently possess\nattributes that allow them to blend in with various plants. The\naverage height of a faerie ranges from about 2 feet to 5 feet,\nbut some faeries grow up to 7 feet tall. All faeries possess\nmembranous wings and they each go through a process of\nmetamorphosis. The process and changes differ from faerie to\nfaerie, but during this transformation each individual manifests\nthe unique appearance they will carry throughout the rest of their\napproximately 50-year lifespan.\nANCESTRY FEATURE\nLuckbender: Once per session, after you or a willing ally within\nClose range makes an action roll, you can spend 3 Hope to reroll\nthe Duality Dice.\nWings: You can fly. While flying, you can mark a Stress after an\nadversary makes an attack against you to gain a +2 bonus to your\nEvasion against that attack.\n57\tChapter 1: Ancestry\n\n-- 58 of 415 --\n\nFAUN\nFauns resemble humanoid goats with curving horns, square\npupils, and cloven hooves. Though their appearances may\nvary, most fauns have a humanoid torso and a goatlike lower\nbody covered in dense fur. Faun faces can be more caprine or\nmore humanlike, and they have a wide variety of ear and horn\nshapes. Faun horns range from short with minimal curvature\nto much larger with a distinct curl. The average faun ranges\nfrom 4 feet to 6 ½ feet tall, but their height can change\ndramatically from one moment to the next based on their\nstance. The majority of fauns have proportionately long limbs,\nno matter their size or shape, and are known for their ability\nto deliver powerful blows with their split hooves. Fauns live\nfor roughly 225 years, and as they age, their appearance can\nbecome increasingly goatlike.\nANCESTRY FEATURES\nCaprine Leap: You can leap anywhere within Close range as\nthough you were using normal movement, allowing you to vault\nobstacles, jump across gaps, or scale barriers with ease.\nKick: When you succeed on an attack against a target within\nMelee range, you can mark a Stress to kick yourself off them,\ndealing an extra 2d6 damage and knocking back either yourself\nor the target to Very Close range.\n58 \tChapter 1: Ancestry\n\n-- 59 of 415 --\n\nFIRBOLG\nFirbolgs are bovine humanoids typically recognized by their\nbroad noses and long, drooping ears. Some have faces that\nare a blend of humanoid and bison, ox, cow, or other bovine\ncreatures. Others, often referred to as minotaurs, have heads\nthat entirely resemble cattle. They are tall and muscular\ncreatures, with heights ranging from around 5 feet to\n7 feet, and possess remarkable strength no matter their age.\nSome firbolgs are known to use this strength to charge their\nadversaries, an action that is particuarly effective for those\nwho have one of the many varieties of horn styles commonly\nfound in this ancestry. Though their unique characteristics can\nvary, all firbolgs are covered in fur, which can be muted and\nearth-toned in color, or come in a variety of pastels, such as\nsoft pinks and blues. On average, firbolgs live for about\n150 years.\nANCESTRY FEATURES\nCharge: When you succeed on an Agility Roll to move from Far\nor Very Far range into Melee range with one or more targets,\nyou can mark a Stress to deal 1d12 physical damage to all\ntargets within Melee range.\nUnshakable: When you would mark a Stress, roll a d6.

While the\ncommon lifespan of a fungril is about 300 years, some have\nbeen reported to live much longer. They can communicate\nnonverbally, and many members of this ancestry use a\nmycelial array to chemically exchange information with other\nfungril across long distances.\nANCESTRY FEATURES\nFungril Network: Make an Instinct Roll (12) to use your\nmycelial array to speak with others of your ancestry. On a\nsuccess, you can communicate across any distance.\nDeath Connection: While touching a corpse that died recently,\nyou can mark a Stress to extract one memory from the corpse\nrelated to a specific emotion or sensation of your choice.\n60 \tChapter 1: Ancestry\n\n-- 61 of 415 --\n\nGALAPA\nGalapa resemble anthropomorphic turtles with large, domed\nshells into which they can retract.

Members of this\nancestry can draw their head, arms, and legs into their shell\nfor protection to use it as a natural shield when defensive\nmeasures are needed. Some supplement their shell's strength\nor appearance by attaching armor or carving unique designs,\nbut the process is exceedingly painful. Most galapa move\nslowly no matter their age, and they can live approximately\n150 years.\nANCESTRY FEATURES\nShell: Gain a bonus to your damage thresholds equal to your\nProficiency.\nRetract: Mark a Stress to retract into your shell. While in\nyour shell, you have resistance to physical damage, you have\ndisadvantage on action rolls, and you can’t move.\n61\tChapter 1: Ancestry\n\n-- 62 of 415 --\n\nGIANT\nGiants are towering humanoids with broad shoulders, long\narms, and one to three eyes. Adult giants range from 6 ½ to\n8 ½ feet tall and are naturally muscular, regardless of body\ntype. They are easily recognized by their wide frames and\nelongated arms and necks. Though they can have up to three\neyes, all giants are born with none and remain sightless for\ntheir first year of life. Until a giant reaches the age of 10 and\ntheir features fully develop, the formation of their eyes may\nfluctuate. Those with a single eye are commonly known as\ncyclops. The average giant lifespan is about 75 years.\nANCESTRY FEATURES\nEndurance: Gain an additional Hit Point slot at character\ncreation.\nReach: Treat any weapon, ability, spell, or other feature that\nhas a Melee range as though it has a Very Close range instead.\n62 \tChapter 1: Ancestry\n\n-- 63 of 415 --\n\nGOBLIN\nGoblins are small humanoids easily recognizable by their large\neyes and massive membranous ears. With keen hearing and\nsharp eyesight, they perceive details both at great distances\nand in darkness, allowing them to move through less-optimal\nenvironments with ease. Their skin and eye colors are\nincredibly varied, with no one hue, either vibrant or subdued,\nmore dominant than another. A typical goblin stands between\n3 feet and 4 feet tall, and each of their ears is about the size\nof their head. Goblins are known to use ear positions to very\nspecific effect when communicating nonverbally. A goblin’s\nlifespan is roughly 100 years, and many maintain their keen\nhearing and sight well into advanced age.\nANCESTRY FEATURES\nSurefooted: You ignore disadvantage on Agility Rolls.\nDanger Sense: Once per rest, mark a Stress to force an\nadversary to reroll an attack against you or an ally within\nVery Close range.\n63\tChapter 1: Ancestry\n\n-- 64 of 415 --\n\nHALFLING\nHalflings are small humanoids with large hairy feet and\nprominent rounded ears. On average, halflings are 3 to 4\nfeet in height, and their ears, nose, and feet are larger in\nproportion to the rest of their body.

They are the descendants of demons\nfrom the Circles Below. On average, infernis range in height\nfrom 5 feet to 7 feet and are known to have long fingers and\npointed nails. Some have long, thin, and smooth tails that end\nin points, forks, or arrowheads. It’s common for infernis to\nhave two or four horns—though some have crowns of many\nhorns, or only one. These horns can also grow asymmetrically,\nforming unique, often curving, shapes that infernis enhance\nwith carving and ornamentation. Their skin, hair, and horns\ncome in an assortment of colors that can include soft pastels,\nstark tones, or vibrant hues, such as rosy scarlet, deep purple,\nand pitch black.\nInfernis possess a “dread visage” that manifests both\ninvoluntarily, such as when they experience fear or other\nstrong emotions, or purposefully, such as when they wish to\nintimidate an adversary. This visage can briefly modify their\nappearance in a variety of ways, including lengthening their\nteeth and nails, changing the colors of their eyes, twisting\ntheir horns, or enhancing their height. On average, infernis live\nup to 350 years, with some attributing this lifespan to their\ndemonic lineage.\nANCESTRY FEATURES\nFearless: When you roll with Fear, you can mark 2 Stress to\nchange it into a roll with Hope instead.\nDread Visage: You have advantage on rolls to intimidate\nhostile creatures.\n66 \tChapter 1: Ancestry\n\n-- 67 of 415 --\n\nKATARI\nKatari are feline humanoids with retractable claws, vertically\nslit pupils, and high, triangular ears.

Their skin and\nfur come in a wide range of hues and patterns, including solid\ncolors, calico tones, tabby stripes, and an array of spots,\npatches, marbling, or bands. Their height ranges from about 3\nfeet to 6 ½ feet, and they live to around 150 years.\nANCESTRY FEATURES\nFeline Instincts: When you make an Agility Roll, you can spend\n2 Hope to reroll your Hope Die.\nRetracting Claws: Make an Agility Roll to scratch a target\nwithin Melee range. On a success, they become temporarily\nVulnerable.\n67\tChapter 1: Ancestry\n\n-- 68 of 415 --\n\nORC\nOrcs are humanoids most easily recognized by their square\nfeatures and boar-like tusks that protrude from their lower jaw.\nTusks come in various sizes, and though they extend from the\nmouth, they aren’t used for consuming food. Instead, many orcs\nchoose to decorate their tusks with significant ornamentation.\nOrcs typically live for 125 years, and unless altered, their tusks\ncontinue to grow throughout the course of their lives. Their ears\nare pointed, and their hair and skin typically have green, blue,\npink, or gray tones. Orcs tend toward a muscular build, and their\naverage height ranges from 5 feet to 6 ½ feet.\nANCESTRY FEATURES\nSturdy: When you have 1 Hit Point remaining, attacks against you\nhave disadvantage.\nTusks: When you succeed on an attack against a target within\nMelee range, you can spend a Hope to gore the target with your\ntusks, dealing an extra 1d6 damage.\n68 \tChapter 1: Ancestry\n\n-- 69 of 415 --\n\nRIBBET\nRibbets resemble anthropomorphic frogs with protruding\neyes and webbed hands and feet. They have smooth (though\nsometimes warty) moist skin and eyes positioned on either\nside of their head. Some ribbets have hind legs more than\ntwice the length of their torso, while others have short limbs.\nNo matter their size (which ranges from about 3 feet to 4\n½ feet), ribbets primarily move by hopping. All ribbets have\nwebbed appendages, allowing them to swim with ease. Some\nribbets possess a natural green-and-brown camouflage, while\nothers are vibrantly colored with bold patterns. No matter\ntheir appearance, all ribbets are born from eggs laid in the\nwater, hatch into tadpoles, and after about 6 to 7 years, grow\ninto amphibians that can move around on land. Ribbets live for\napproximately 100 years.\nANCESTRY FEATURES\nAmphibious: You can breathe and move naturally underwater.\nLong Tongue: You can use your long tongue to grab onto things\nwithin Close range. Mark a Stress to use your tongue as a\nFinesse Close weapon that deals d12 physical damage using\nyour Proficiency.\n69\tChapter 1: Ancestry\n\n-- 70 of 415 --\n\nSIMIAH\nSimiah resemble anthropomorphic monkeys and apes with\nlong limbs and prehensile feet. While their appearance\nreflects all simian creatures, from the largest gorilla to the\nsmallest marmoset, their size does not align with their animal\ncounterparts, and they can be anywhere from 2 to 6 feet\ntall. All simiah can use their dexterous feet for nonverbal\ncommunication, work, and combat. Additionally, some\nalso have prehensile tails that can grasp objects or help\nwith balance during difficult maneuvers. These traits grant\nmembers of this ancestry unique agility that aids them in\na variety of physical tasks. In particular, simiah are skilled\nclimbers and can easily transition from bipedal movement to\nknuckle-walking and climbing, and back again. On average,\nsimiah live for about 100 years.\nANCESTRY FEATURES\nNatural Climber: You have advantage on Agility Rolls that\ninvolve balancing and climbing.\nNimble: Gain a permanent +1 bonus to your Evasion at\ncharacter creation.\n70 \tChapter 1: Ancestry\n\n-- 71 of 415 --\n\nMIXED ANCESTRY\nFamilies within the world of Daggerheart are as unique as the\npeoples and cultures that inhabit it. Anyone’s appearance and skill\nset can be shaped by blood, magic, proximity, or a variety of other\nfactors.\nIf you decide that your character is a descendant of multiple\nancestries and you want to mechanically represent that in the\ngame, use the steps below:\nSTEP 1: DETERMINE ANCESTRY COMBINATION\nWhen you choose an ancestry at character creation, write down\nhow your character identifies themself in the Heritage section\nof your character sheet. For example, your ancestry could be\n“goblin-orc,” or just “goblin” (with orc in their lineage), or a\nname you choose, like “toothling.”\nSTEP 2: CHOOSE ANCESTRY FEATURES\nWork with your GM to choose two features from the ancestries\nin your character’s lineage.\nYou must choose the first feature from one ancestry and the\nsecond from another. Write both down on a notecard you can keep\nwith your other cards or next to your character sheet. For example,\nif you are making a goblin-orc, you might take the “Surefooted” and\n“Tusks” features or the “Sturdy” and “Danger Sense” features. You\ncan’t take both the “Surefooted” and “Sturdy” features.\nIf your character's heritage includes more\nthan two ancestries, you only choose\nfeatures from two. You can represent\nadditional ancestries through their\nappearance or backstory.\nINFERNIS-RIBBET\n\"HORNED TOAD\"\nFAERIE-SIMIAH\n\"FLITTERIN\"\nFUNGRIL-GALAPA\n\"SHROOMSHELL\"\n71\tChapter 1: Ancestry\n\n-- 72 of 415 --\n\nCommunity\nCommunities represent the culture or environment your character grew up in. Though a\ncharacter might have been a member of numerous communities during their upbringing, this\nchoice represents the one they feel had the most influence over their personality and current\nskill set.\nAs with ancestries, describing the characteristics of a\ncollective is nuanced, as people always view others through\nthe lens of their own experience. For example, while a\nseaborne sailor might feel their own community is particularly\nstrict, a character from an orderborne metropolis might find\nthat group very changeable. An individual’s relationship with\ntheir community also creates a wide variety of experiences. If\nyour character has fallen out with the people that defined their\nupbringing, they might continue to carry that influence but\nalso strive to live differently than they were taught.\nAs you explore the communities in this section, imagine the\nvariety of ways they might manifest in your game. Some\ncommunity cards reference locations, others an ethos, and\nothers a common goal, but no two places that fall under the\nsame category are identical. If one wanderborne caravan\ntravels the world willingly and another was expelled from their\nhome by force, each community’s material trappings and their\npeople’s feelings about their lifestyle would be very different.\nWhen you build your character, you can draw inspiration from\ncommunities other than the one you’ve chosen. As always, this\naspect of the game is meant to be utilized in the way that best\nserves your group.\nEach community has a community feature granted to your\ncharacter by their community that can be utilized in play.\nTip: Each community entry suggests six adjectives that you\ncan use as inspiration when crafting a character. If you’d\nlike, choose one or more of these words (or roll a d6) to help\ndevelop your character’s personality, their relationship with\ntheir upbringing or peers, or even the demeanor with which\nthey interact with the rest of their party.\nHIGHBORNE\n72 \tChapter 1: Community\n\n-- 73 of 415 --\n\nHIGHBORNE\nBeing part of a highborne community means you're accustomed to\na life of elegance, opulence, and prestige within the upper echelons\nof society. Traditionally, members of a highborne community\npossess incredible material wealth. While this can take a variety\nof forms depending on the community—including gold and other\nminerals, land, or controlling the means of production—this status\nalways comes with power and influence. Highborne place great\nvalue on titles and possessions, and there is little social mobility\nwithin their ranks. Members of a highborne community often\ncontrol the political and economic status of the areas in which they\nlive due to their ability to influence people and the economy with\ntheir substantial wealth. The health and safety of the less affluent\npeople who live in these locations often hinges on the ability of this\nhighborne ruling class to prioritize the well-being of their subjects\nover profit.\nHighborne are often amiable, candid, conniving, enterprising,\nostentatious, and unflappable.\nCOMMUNITY FEATURE\nPrivilege: You have advantage on rolls to consort with nobles,\nnegotiate prices, or leverage your reputation to get what you want.\n73\tChapter 1: Community\n\n-- 74 of 415 --\n\nLOREBORNE\nBeing part of a loreborne community means you’re from a\nsociety that favors strong academic or political prowess.\nLoreborne communities highly value knowledge, frequently\nin the form of historical preservation, political advancement,\nscientific study, skill development, or lore and mythology\ncompilation. Most members of these communities research in\ninstitutions built in bastions of civilization, while some eclectic\nfew thrive in gathering information from the natural world.\nSome may be isolationists, operating in smaller enclaves,\nschools, or guilds and following their own unique ethos.\nOthers still wield their knowledge on a larger scale, making\ndeft political maneuvers across governmental landscapes.\nLoreborne are often direct, eloquent, inquisitive, patient,\nrhapsodic, and witty.\nCOMMUNITY FEATURE\nWell-Read: You have advantage on rolls that involve the\nhistory, culture, or politics of a prominent person or place.\n74 \tChapter 1: Community\n\n-- 75 of 415 --\n\nORDERBORNE\nBeing part of an orderborne community\nmeans you’re from a collective that\nfocuses on discipline or faith, and you\nuphold a set of principles that reflect\nyour experience there. Orderborne are\nfrequently some of the most powerful\namong the surrounding communities.\nBy aligning the members of their society\naround a common value or goal, such as\na god, doctrine, ethos, or even a shared\nbusiness or trade, the ruling bodies\nof these enclaves are able to mobilize\nlarger populations with less effort.\nWhile orderborne communities take a\nvariety of forms—some even profoundly\npacifistic—perhaps the most feared\nare those that structure themselves\naround military prowess. In such a case,\nit’s not uncommon for orderborne to\nprovide soldiers for hire to other cities or\ncountries.\nOrderborne are often ambitious,\nbenevolent, pensive, prudent, sardonic,\nand stoic.\nCOMMUNITY FEATURE\nDedicated: Record three sayings or\nvalues your upbringing instilled in you.\nOnce per rest, when you describe how\nyou’re embodying one of these principles\nthrough your current action, you can roll a\nd20 as your Hope Die.\n75\tChapter 1: Community\n\n-- 76 of 415 --\n\nRIDGEBORNE\nBeing part of a ridgeborne community means you’ve called the rocky peaks and sharp cliffs of the mountainside home. Those\nwho’ve lived in the mountains often consider themselves hardier than most because they’ve thrived among the most dangerous\nterrain many continents have to offer. These groups are adept at adaptation, developing unique technologies and equipment\nto move both people and products across difficult terrain. As such, ridgeborne grow up scrambling and climbing, making them\nsturdy and strong-willed. Ridgeborne localities appear in a variety of forms—some cities carve out entire cliff faces, others\nconstruct castles of stone, and still more live in small homes on windblown peaks. Outside forces often struggle to attack\nridgeborne groups, as the small militias and large military forces of the mountains are adept at utilizing their high-ground\nadvantage.\nRidgeborne are often bold, hardy, indomitable, loyal, reserved, and stubborn.\nCOMMUNITY FEATURE\nSteady: You have advantage on rolls to traverse dangerous\ncliffs and ledges, navigate harsh environments, and use your\nsurvival knowledge.\n76 \tChapter 1: Community\n\n-- 77 of 415 --\n\nSEABORNE\nBeing part of a seaborne community means you lived on or near a large body of water. Seaborne\ncommunities are built, both physically and culturally, around the specific waters they call home.\nSome of these groups live along the shore, constructing ports for locals and travelers alike. These\nharbors function as centers of commerce, tourist attractions, or even just a safe place to lay\ndown one’s head after weeks of travel. Other seaborne live on the water in small boats or large\nships, with the idea of “home” comprising a ship and its crew, rather than any one landmass.\nNo matter their exact location, seaborne communities are closely tied to the ocean tides and the\ncreatures who inhabit them. Seaborne learn to fish at a young age, and train from birth to hold\ntheir breath and swim in even the most tumultuous waters. Individuals from these groups are\nhighly sought after for their sailing skills, and many become captains of vessels, whether within\ntheir own community, working for another, or even at the helm of a powerful naval operation.\nSeaborne are often candid, cooperative, exuberant, fierce, resolute, and weathered.\nCOMMUNITY FEATURE\nKnow the Tide: You can sense the ebb and flow of life. When you roll with Fear, place a token\non your community card. You can hold a number of tokens equal to your level. Before you make\nan action roll, you can spend any number of these tokens to gain a +1 bonus to the roll for each\ntoken spent. At the end of each session, clear all unspent tokens.\n77\tChapter 1: Community\n\n-- 78 of 415 --\n\nSLYBORNE\nBeing part of a slyborne community means you come from a group\nthat operates outside the law, including all manner of criminals,\ngrifters, and con artists. Members of slyborne communities are\nbrought together by their disreputable goals and their clever means of\nachieving them. Many people in these communities have an array of\nunscrupulous skills: forging, thievery, smuggling, and violence. People\nof any social class can be slyborne, from those who have garnered\nvast wealth and influence to those without a coin to their name. To\nthe outside eye, slyborne might appear to be ruffians with no loyalty,\nbut these communities possess some of the strictest codes of honor\nwhich, when broken, can result in a terrifying end for the transgressor.\nSlyborne are often calculating, clever, formidable, perceptive, shrewd,\nand tenacious.\nCOMMUNITY FEATURE\nScoundrel: You have advantage on rolls to negotiate with criminals,\ndetect lies, or find a safe place to hide.\n78 \tChapter 1: Community\n\n-- 79 of 415 --\n\nUNDERBORNE\nBeing part of an underborne community means you’re from a subterranean society. Many\nunderborne live right beneath the cities and villages of other collectives, while some live much\ndeeper. These communities range from small family groups in burrows to massive metropolises\nin caverns of stone. In many locales, underborne are recognized for their incredible boldness and\nskill that enable great feats of architecture and engineering. Underborne are regularly hired for\ntheir bravery, as even the least daring among them has likely encountered formidable belowground\nbeasts, and learning to dispatch such creatures is common practice amongst these societies.\nBecause of the dangers of their environment, many underborne communities develop unique\nnonverbal languages that prove equally useful on the surface.\nUnderborne are often composed, elusive, indomitable, innovative, resourceful, and unpretentious.\nCOMMUNITY FEATURE\nLow-Light Living: When you’re in an area with low light or heavy shadow, you have advantage on\nrolls to hide, investigate, or perceive details within that area.\n79\tChapter 1: Community\n\n-- 80 of 415 --\n\nWANDERBORNE\nBeing part of a wanderborne community means you’ve lived as\na nomad, forgoing a permanent home and experiencing a wide\nvariety of cultures. Unlike many communities that are defined\nby their locale, wanderborne are defined by their traveling\nlifestyle. Because of their frequent migration, wanderborne\nput less value on the accumulation of material possessions in\nfavor of acquiring information, skills, and connections. While\nsome wanderborne are allied by a common ethos, such as a\nreligion or a set of political or economic values, others come\ntogether after shared tragedy, such as the loss of their home\nor land. No matter the reason, the dangers posed by life on\nthe road and the choice to continue down that road together\nmean that wanderborne are known for their unwavering\nloyalty.\nWanderborne are often inscrutable, magnanimous, mirthful,\nreliable, savvy, and unorthodox.\nCOMMUNITY FEATURE\nNomadic Pack: Add a Nomadic Pack to your inventory. Once\nper session, you can spend a Hope to reach into this pack and\npull out a mundane item that’s useful to your situation. Work\nwith the GM to figure out what item you take out.\n80 \tChapter 1: Community\n\n-- 81 of 415 --\n\nWILDBORNE\nBeing part of a wildborne community means you lived deep within the forest. Wildborne communities are defined by their\ndedication to the conservation of their homelands, and many have strong religious or cultural ties to the fauna they live among.\nThis results in unique architectural and technological advancements that favor sustainability over short-term, high-yield results.\nIt is a hallmark of wildborne societies to integrate their villages and cities with the natural environment and avoid disturbing the\nlives of the plants and animals. While some construct their lodgings high in the branches of trees, others establish their homes\non the ground beneath the forest canopy. It’s not uncommon for wildborne to remain reclusive and hidden within their woodland\nhomes.\nWildborne are often hardy, loyal, nurturing, reclusive, sagacious, and vibrant.\nCOMMUNITY FEATURE\nLightfoot: Your movement is naturally silent. You have\nadvantage on rolls to move without being heard.\n81\tChapter 1: Community\n\n-- 82 of 415 --\n\nAdditional player guidance\nThis section provides guidance for playing disabled characters in Daggerheart.\nADJUSTING ABILITIES AND SPELLS\nSome abilities and spells in Daggerheart designate the use of\nparticular assets and senses, including sight, sound, touch,\nand movement. Like players, characters can be blind, deaf,\nor mute, have disabilities or limb differences, or possess any\nnumber of unique qualities that occur among individuals.\nJust as there is no set style for weapons combat, there is no\nset style of spellcasting within Daggerheart. No spell requires\nspecific language or motions. For example, sign language is\nequally viable for a Wordsmith bard as anything spoken aloud.\nIf instructions in the game aren't a good fit for your character's\nabilities (such as a blind PC’s spell affecting “a target you can\nsee”), work with your GM to adjust the requirements of that\neffect. For example, you might choose to make one of the\nfollowing adjustments to the rules or campaign:\n• Utilize another sense (“a target you can hear”)\n• Specify the mechanical range (“within Close range”)\n• Add narrative character details (the PC uses an\naid or magical means to perceive the target)\n• Address it through worldbuilding (the Mortal\nRealm is accessible for disabled characters)\nSupporting the enjoyment of everyone at the table means\nmodifying the spells, abilities, and other aspects of\nDaggerheart as you see fit. We invite you to adjust the flavor\nof cards based on the lines and veils established by the group\n(see the “Session Zero and Safety Tools” section on page\n169). For example, a player might want their druid to use the\nConjure Swarm spell, but either they or another player feel\nuncomfortable with bugs. In that case, they could conjure\nother objects such as flower petals, small birds, or even a\nspecific bug (such as a butterfly) that everyone is comfortable\nwith. All players, including the GM, should abide by the\ncustomizations made to accommodate one another.\n82 \tChapter 1: Additional Player Guidance\n\n-- 83 of 415 --\n\nPLAYING DISABILITY WITH\nPURPOSE AND RESPECT\nBy Rue Dickey\nPortraying lived experiences—such as disability—other\nthan your own is a powerful way to broaden your perspective\nwhen done with respect. Equality, disability, accessibility,\nand accommodations are a meaningful part of fantasy\nworldbuilding. For players interested in exploring these\nelements at the table, it’s important to take care to avoid\nstereotypes and learn from disabled people themselves.\nDISABLED IDENTITY\nLike other marginalizations—such as race, gender, and\nsexuality— disability is just as much an identity as a state\nof being. When playing a disabled character, it’s important\nto remember that disabilities are a part of people, not a\nmask they can take off. Different individuals have different\nexperiences with their disability, such as how long they’ve\nbeen disabled, how society has treated them because of it,\nand how accommodations for their disability are handled.\nAll of these elements are important to consider when\nbuilding a disabled character, NPC, or fantasy world\nwith accommodations.\nDisability is a broad category, and some are more visible—\nboth literally and metaphorically—than others. Some\ndisabilities commonly touched on and explored at the table\ninclude limb difference, low mobility and mobility aids, low\nvision, hearing loss, neurodivergence, and mental illness.\nMobility aids and prosthetics are most commonly included in\ndisabled representation, but it is also important to remember\nthat there are countless “invisible” disabilities, such as chronic\nillnesses, chronic pain, genetic disorders, and autoimmune\nconditions. Neurodivergence—a blanket term that covers\nautism, ADHD, learning or cognitive disabilities, PTSD, and\nmore—and mental illness can also sometimes be considered\ninvisible disabilities. When building an inclusive world, it is\nimportant to consider disabled people from all walks of life,\nnot just those who are most visible.\nMOBILITY AIDS, PROSTHETICS, AND\nACCESSIBILITY TOOLS IN FANTASY\nA key aspect of playing and including disabled characters\nin your narratives is ensuring that accessibility tools are a\npart of the setting. “Accessibility tools” is a broad category\nfor anything that makes the world more navigable for a\ndisabled person, from glasses and hearing aids to prosthetics,\nwheelchairs, canes, and more.\nThese mobility aids and accessibility tools can take inspiration\nfrom real life, using modern technology or historical reference.\nPeople have invented new ways to help disabled people\naccess the world for thousands of years. But you should also\nfeel empowered to get fun and fantastical with it—maybe a\nprosthetic grown from plants and vines, or a wheelchair that\nfloats using magic better align with your PC or the campaign.\nIf you’d like to implement a mobility aid mechanically, see the\n“Combat Wheelchair” section on page 122.\nTELLING DISABLED STORIES\nWhen playing a disabled character, or when including\ndisabled characters as central elements in the plot, it’s\nimportant to know what sort of story you’re telling. Is the\nadventurer’s disability a central element of their character?\nIs it part of their backstory or something they gained as\npart of their adventures? How do they engage with that\npart of their identity—are they proud of their disability,\ncoming to terms with it, or looking for new coping\nstrategies? All of these stories are valid explorations\nand will have different implications and directions for\nyour character’s journey throughout the narrative.\nSome players will want mechanical involvement for\ntheir disabilities, while others will want more narrative\nflavor without the mechanical aspects.\nAbove all, make sure to collaborate on the worlds you build,\nthe characters you create, and the stories you tell. Be open\nto adjustment and change, and take care of yourself and your\nfellow players. The game will be safer, richer, and more fun if\neveryone has a seat at the table.\n83\tChapter 1: Additional Player Guidance\n\n-- 84 of 415 --\n\nPLAYING A BLIND OR VISUALLY\nIMPAIRED CHARACTER\nBy Deven Rue\nFor ease of information, this section uses the term blind to\nrefer to individuals who lack all sight, and visually impaired\n(VI) to refer to individuals with low vision, who have visual\nimpairments, or who are legally blind by definition.\nThough every individual in the blind/VI community has their\nown experiences and preferences, here are a few tips on how\nto play a blind/VI character respectfully. First, consider the\nfollowing when developing their backstory:\n• If your character was born blind/VI, remember that\nfrom very young ages, blind/VI children develop\ntheir own methods to interact with the world.\n• If your character wasn’t born blind/VI, what caused,\nor is causing them, to lose their vision? A sudden\nloss of sight can be traumatic, creating a sense of\nhelplessness until they learn ways to adapt.\n• If your character is visually impaired, what level of\nsight do they have? Do they see only shadows and\nlight? Or are things blurry blobs at a distance?\n• Does your character want to gain or regain their sight?\nNot all blind/VI individuals care about “curing” their\nsight, especially if they’re born that way. It’s hard to miss\nsomething they have never had, and some treasure their\nunique interpretation of the world. On the other hand,\nthose who’ve lost their vision might wish to regain it.\n• Will your character use a cane? Blind/VI people don’t\nuse canes to “see”; rather, they use them to gather\ninformation about the surface they’re walking on (by\nsound or how far their cane sinks into the ground), inclines\nor descents, and the edges of objects around them.\n• Does your character have a service animal or familiar?\nBlind/VI people develop close bonds with their service\nanimals, and these companions alert them of potential\ndanger or obstacles, guide them, and bring them items\nthey need. While characters who weren’t born blind/\nVI could potentially see through the eyes of a familiar, a\ncharacter who was born blind might not understand the\nimages a familiar projects into their mind, as they haven’t\nexperienced sight and don’t have the necessary context.\nStrive to give blind/VI PCs and NPCs the same level of\nindependence and function as other characters in your game,\nand make them common enough to let others know they not\nonly exist in your world, they thrive.\nWhen roleplaying, you’re encouraged to include descriptions\nthat go beyond appearance. Blind/VI people do not inherently\nhave heightened smell or hearing, but these senses can\ninform them about their environment. Think about an area’s\nscent, temperature, wind flow, and more. Describe obstacles,\npeople, and enemies in relation to their current position,\nsuch as stating that someone is “several paces in front” of a\ncharacter or referencing a clock face or compass (where the\ncharacter is always standing in the middle).\nAbove all, don’t be afraid to play a blind/VI character and open\nyourself up to these roleplaying opportunities, experiences,\nand perspectives.\nPLAYING A DEAF CHARACTER\nBy Rogan Shannon\nDeaf people exist on a wide spectrum ranging from mild to\nprofound deafness. Some are deaf in one ear, but otherwise\nhear and speak, while others are entirely deaf and living in a\nfully visual world—or one of the many possible combinations\nin between. When you play a Deaf character, consider the\nmany factors that influence how they move through their life.\nThe following questions are a good place to start:\n• Have they been deaf since birth, or did they\nbecome deaf later in life from illness or injury?\n• How do they choose to communicate with their\nfriends, loved ones, and the world at large?\n• Growing up, did they learn how to speak, use\nsign language, or a combination of the two?\n• If they don’t speak the predominant language, how do\nthey communicate? Do they use paper and pen? Or do\nthey have accommodations, magical or otherwise?\n• Is this person a loner, keeping to themself and\ninteracting with people only when they have to, or are\nthey part of a community of other Deaf people?\nAs an accommodation for a Deaf character, the GM and\nplayers can flavor scenes using other senses. For example,\nthe character might feel the rumbling of a dragon’s deep roar\nor the intense heat from a fire spell, rather than hearing the\nbellow or an explosion of flame. They may have a metallic\ntaste in their mouth and hair standing up on their arms as the\nair crackles with electricity. Rather than hearing the groan of\nthe undead, their nose might be assaulted with the pungent\nscent of rot.\nWhen roleplaying, be mindful of how you portray the\ncharacter’s chosen communication mode. Either speak as you\nnormally would or be intentional about how you do it.\nAbove all, Deaf people are people. Play them as you would any\nother character while considering the added layer of how they\nmove through the world differently due to communication\nneeds. If you’re able, don’t hesitate to ask someone Deaf for\nideas and feedback.\n84 \tChapter 1: Additional Player Guidance\n\n-- 85 of 415 --\n\n85\tChapter 1: Additional Player Guidance\n\n-- 86 of 415 --\n\n\n\n-- 87 of 415 --\n\nCHAPTER TWO:\nPLAYING AN ADVENTURE\nIn this chapter, we’ll cover what you need to know as a player\nto start your adventure, including the core mechanics, combat,\nleveling up, equipment, and a few optional rules you can add to\nyour game.\nFlow of the Game\nIn a session of Daggerheart, you and the other players go around the table describing\nwhat your characters do in the fictional circumstances that the GM sets up, building on\neach other’s ideas and working together to tell an exciting story. The mechanics of the\ngame help facilitate this conversation, providing structure to the discussion and a way\nto resolve moments when there are several exciting possibilities for what happens next.\nEveryone at the table should ask questions and integrate the answers into the game.\nAs a player, you’ll often ask clarifying questions about the scene: “Are there any guards\noutside the door?” or “What kind of weapon are they holding?” or “Can I jump across\nthe gap safely?” The GM might answer questions directly: “There are four guards\noutside the door,” or “They’re weilding longswords.” They might also ask you to roll to\ndetermine the answer: “It’s raining and dark, so let’s see how well you jump the gap.\nGive me an Agility Roll, Difficulty 11.”\nIn turn, the GM asks you questions and builds on those answers to create the fiction:\n“How are you able to sneak around this building so carefully?” or “What does the\ncamp you’ve set up look like?” or “You’ve found a way to safely scramble up the wall—\nwhat made your climb easier than you anticipated?” This back and forth creates a\ncollaborative conversation where everyone can meaningfully contribute to the fiction.\nFor those familiar with roleplaying games, the flow of the game might come naturally,\nbut if you’re new to this experience, it might not. The following steps outline an\nexample of the gameplay loop that drives every session. This gameplay loop will be\ndescribed in more detail in the upcoming sections.\nSTEP 1:\nTHE GM NARRATES DETAILS\nSTEP 2:\nTHE PLAYERS AND GM ASK QUESTIONS\nSTEP 3:\nTHE PLAYERS AND GM ANSWER QUESTIONS\nSTEP 4:\nCHOOSE AND RESOLVE ACTIONS\nSTEP 5:\nREPEAT THE CYCLE\n87\tChapter 2: Flow of the Game\n\n-- 88 of 415 --\n\nSTEP 1:\nTHE GM NARRATES DETAILS\nThe GM lays out a scene, describing the surroundings,\ndangers, NPCs, and any important elements the characters\nwould notice immediately.\nSTEP 2:\nTHE PLAYERS AND GM\nASK QUESTIONS\nThe players ask questions to explore the scene in more depth,\ngathering information to help them decide their characters’\nactions. When appropriate, the GM can ask the players to\ndescribe elements of a scene, leaving their own influence on\nthe world.\nSTEP 3:\nTHE PLAYERS AND GM\nANSWER QUESTIONS\nThe GM responds to these questions by giving the players\ninformation their characters can easily obtain. The players\nalso respond to any questions the GM poses to them. If they\nwant more insight than what is readily available, the GM\ninforms players what dice roll or action they must make to\nobtain more information.\nSTEP 4:\nCHOOSE AND RESOLVE ACTIONS\nAs the GM describes the scene and provides information, they\nlead the players to opportunities to take action—problems\nto solve, obstacles to overcome, mysteries to investigate,\nand so on. As the players pursue these opportunities, the GM\nhelps facilitate their characters’ actions, and everyone works\ntogether to move the fiction forward based on the outcome.\nIf the players aren’t compelled into action right away, the GM\ncontinues to provide more details, conflict, or consequences\nuntil they are.\nSTEP 5:\nREPEAT THE CYCLE\nBecause the scene has changed in some way, this process\nrepeats from the beginning.\nEXAMPLE INTERACTION\nA noble just caught Nolan’s character, Lavelle, trying to\nsteal an important letter from their bag in a busy market\nsquare at the center of town.\n“How many guards did you say this noble had?” Nolan asks\nStella, the GM.\n“Two right there with him, and you suspect that there’s\nanother two out-of-uniform and back in the crowd.”\n“Great. I’m by an alley, right? I want to back off and find\na place to climb up to the rooftop before anyone can\ncatch me.”\n“Sure thing,” Stella says. Based on the situation, she\ndecides that Nolan doesn’t need to roll for Lavelle to\naccomplish what they want to do. “You’re fast, and\nthankfully the noble is the one who spotted you, not the\nguards—so you can scramble up without a roll. The guards\nwill be following you, though, and once you’re on the roof,\nthey’re going to draw their crossbows and start shooting.”\nNolan asks, “How close are the buildings? Could I leap onto\nthe next building’s roof?”\n“They’re not that far apart,” Stella says. “Certainly not\nany wider than what you’re used to from growing up in\nDownside. That’d be an Agility Roll to escape across the\nrooftops. But heads up—if you don’t succeed here, you’ll\nprobably take some serious damage from the fall. It’s a long\nway down.” Lavelle has a +2 Agility, and Nolan spends a\nHope to use Lavelle’s Scoundrel Experience, adding a +2\nbonus to the roll to make the leap.\n“I know it’s dangerous, but I’ve done this kind of jump\nbefore.” Nolan gathers 4 character tokens to represent his\nAgility and Scoundrel bonuses, then rolls his Duality Dice.\nThe Hope Die lands on a 9 and the Fear Die lands on 4. He\ncombines those values together—adding up to 13—then\nadds his 4 character tokens for a total of 17. Because his\nHope Die rolled higher than his Fear Die, Nolan tells the GM:\n“I rolled a 17 with Hope!”\nStella nods. Nolan’s total of 17 is higher than the Difficulty\nof 15 she had in mind, and a success with Hope means\nthere are no negative consequences for the action. “That’s\nmore than enough to escape these guards. They’re armored\nand trying to take shots, but none of them get close to\nyou—and they’re not good enough at jumping to risk a fall.\nBy the time you’re two blocks away, you’ve completely lost\nthem. Make sure to gain a Hope for that roll. But now you’re\nfarther away from the noble and the letter you were trying\nto steal from him. What do you do?”\n88 \tChapter 2: Flow of the Game\n\n-- 89 of 415 --\n\nCore Mechanics\nThis section explains the core mechanics of Daggerheart and how to use them.\nTHE SPOTLIGHT\nAny time a character becomes the focus of a scene, they’re\nin the spotlight. Even if many characters are involved in a\ndramatic moment, there is often one character leading the\naction. This might be the PC pulling their ally to safety, the\nNPC haggling over the price of rare goods, or the adversary\nattacking with their foul weapon. The spotlight organically\nmoves around the table as scenes unfold, but the mechanics\nof the game might also determine where the spotlight goes\nnext. For example, if a player rolls with Fear on their Duality\nDice during combat, the mechanics allow the GM to then\nspotlight an adversary to act against the heroes.\nON YOUR TURN\nDaggerheart’s turns don’t follow a traditional, rigid format;\nyou don’t have a set number of actions you can take or things\nyou can do before play passes to someone else. Players\nshould follow the natural flow of the fiction to figure out what\nhappens next, bouncing the spotlight around the table to\nwhoever it makes sense to focus on in that moment. However,\nall players should keep in mind who has recently had the\nspotlight and try to find opportunities to give every character\na chance to act.\nOPTIONAL TOOL: SPOTLIGHT TRACKER\nIf your group prefers tactical play or structured player\nturns, you can limit the number of actions each PC has\navailable to them at a time. We recommend that you start\nwith three, but you can increase or decrease the number\nas your table prefers.\nIf you use this system, when a battle begins, every\nplayer places action tokens on their character sheets to\nrepresent how many actions they can take. Players then\nact as usual, and each time they make an action roll or\nperform a significant action while in the spotlight, they\nremove 1 token from their sheet. Collaborate with other\nplayers to pass play around the table, making moves and\ntelling the story together. Even if you have multiple action\ntokens, see if any other players want a chance to act\nbefore you spend more than one in a row.\nOnce every player has used all their available tokens,\nplayers refill their character sheet with the same number\nof tokens as before, then continue playing.\nMAKING MOVES\nWhen you decide to do something in the story and the\nspotlight shifts to you, your PC makes a move, which you\ndescribe to the group. A move is an action a character takes\nto advance the story, such as talking to another character,\ninteracting with the environment, using a class feature or\nspell, or anything else a character can do within the scene.\nSome low-stakes moves automatically succeed—it’s easy to\nopen an unlocked door. But while heroic, high-stakes moves\noften require a roll to determine the outcome—it’s hard to\nbreak down a barricaded door. When you make a move and\nthe result of that action is in question, the fiction pauses while\nyou make an action roll to see how things play out.\nMOVES IN COMBAT\nSince Daggerheart is a collaborative and conversational\nstorytelling experience between the GM and players, combat\nhas no initiative order, no rounds, and no distinct number of\nactions you can take while in the spotlight. Instead, fights play\nout narratively from moment to moment, just like noncombat\nscenes. This freeform combat gives players the freedom\nand opportunity to team up, respond on the fly to narrative\nchanges in the scene, and follow the fiction. If they aren’t\nmechanically locked into combat, players might find it easier\nto choose a solution other than violence, such as having their\ncharacters flee from their opponents or come to a temporary\ntruce with their enemies.\nGM MOVES AND ADVERSARY ACTIONS\nPCs aren’t the only ones who make moves—the GM can make\na GM move (see the “Making Moves” section on page 149).\nGM moves can happen at nearly any time, but they most\ncommonly occur when a PC rolls with Fear or fails an action\nroll. Typically, GM moves escalate the scene in an exciting and\ndangerous way. A new threat might emerge from the woods,\nthe PCs could be separated by a sudden cave-in, or another\nsimilar action may significantly change the scene. When the\nGM is finished with their turn, play returns to the PCs. This\ncreates a back-and-forth conversation as the story evolves\norganically between the GM and players.\nMany GM moves don’t require spending any resources, but\nthe GM can spend Fear to make additional or more powerful\nmoves, such as using an adversary or environment’s Fear\nmove (see the “Fear” section on page 154).\nTip: When the GM has the spotlight, PCs can’t use features\nthat require spending resources or making rolls unless those\nactions specifically allow for it, such as reaction rolls or\nfeatures that interrupt attack or damage rolls.\n89\tChapter 2: Core Mechanics\n\n-- 90 of 415 --\n\nDUALITY DICE\nThe core dice in Daggerheart are a pair of d12s called Duality\nDice. Choose two d12s of different colors (or if you prefer,\ndifferent sizes or patterns)—one to represent Hope and the\nother to represent Fear. Your Duality Dice should be easily\nrecognizable from each other at a glance. You’ll use these dice\nany time you make an action roll.\nExample: Quinn looks at their dice and decides on a blue\nd12 to represent Hope and a red d12 to represent Fear.\nAliyah looks at her dice and chooses a yellow d12 to\nrepresent Hope and a purple d12 to represent Fear.\nNolan thinks about using a black d12 with red inking as\nthe Fear Die and a black d12 with white inking as his Hope\nDie, but decides to go with an orange d12 as his Hope Die\ninstead so that it’s easier to identify.\nThe Duality Dice represent the way the world pushes the\ncharacter back or guides them forward throughout the story.\nRegardless of whether you succeed or fail on an action roll, the\nDuality of Hope and Fear influences how the scene evolves.\nROLLING WITH HOPE AND FEAR\nOne of your Duality Dice is your Hope Die, and the other is\nyour Fear Die.\nHope: When you roll your Duality Dice and the Hope Die\nrolls higher than the Fear Die, you roll with Hope. When\nthis happens on an action roll, even if you fail, mark one of\nthe Hope slots on your character sheet. You might also gain\nHope from spells, abilities, or other events that happen\nduring the game.\nFear: When you roll your Duality Dice and the Fear Die\nrolls higher than the Hope Die, you roll with Fear. When\nthis happens on an action roll, even if you succeed, the GM\ngains a Fear and there are consequences or complications\nthat come from the action you were attempting.\nCritical Successes\nWhen you roll the Duality Dice and both dice roll the same\nnumber, that is a critical success. A critical success counts as\na roll with Hope, even if you would’ve otherwise failed because\nthe total is lower than the roll’s Difficulty.\nWhen you critically succeed on a roll, along with gaining a\nHope, you also clear a Stress from your character sheet.\nAdditionally, when you critically succeed on an attack roll, you\ndeal extra damage as described in the “Damage Rolls” section\non page 98.\nUSING HOPE\nWhen you’ve gained Hope and recorded it on your character\nsheet, you can spend it to power special abilities, clearing it\nfrom your character sheet when you do. Your Hope carries\nover between sessions, but you can only hold a maximum of 6\nHope at a time, so we recommend you look for opportunities\nto spend it. Hope can be used in several ways: to Help an Ally,\nto Utilize an Experience, to Initiate a Tag Team Roll, or to\nActivate a Hope Feature.\nHelp an Ally\nYou can spend a Hope to Help an Ally who is making an\naction roll you could feasibly support. When you do this,\ndescribe how you’re helping and roll a d6 advantage die (see\nthe “Advantage and Disadvantage” section on page 100). Any\nnumber of PCs can Help an Ally as long as they spend a Hope\nto do so. The ally being helped might also gain advantage\non the roll from another source; in this case, they’d roll their\nown d6 advantage die. If the ally has gained advantage on\na roll from multiple sources, they take the highest of all the\nadvantage dice rolled and add the result to their action roll.\nUtilize an Experience\nYou can spend a Hope to use one of your relevant Experiences\non an action or reaction roll, adding its modifier to the result.\nIf more than one Experience applies to the situation, you can\nspend an additional Hope for each Experience you want to use.\nInitiate a Tag Team Roll\nYou can spend three Hope to initiate a Tag Team Roll between\nyou and another PC in order to combine your efforts together\nin an exciting and scene-defining moment (see the “Tag Team\nRolls” section on page 97).\nActivate a Hope Feature\nA Hope Feature is any effect that allows (or requires) you to\nspend Hope to activate its effects. If the text instructs you to\n“spend Hope,” you must spend the specified number of Hope,\nor you can’t trigger the Hope Feature.\nWhen using a Hope Feature, if you rolled with Hope for that\naction, the Hope you gain from that roll can be spent on that\nfeature (or toward it, if it requires spending multiple Hope).\nIf you didn’t roll with Hope, you’ll need to spend Hope you\ngained from previous rolls to activate the effect.\nTip: Some effects only trigger on a success with Hope. This\ndoesn’t mean you can spend Hope on a successful roll with\nFear to get the effect; it means the effect only occurs when\nyou roll with Hope and succeed on your action roll. You don’t\nneed to spend Hope to activate these effects—they happen\nas long as the conditions of the roll are met.\nEach class has a unique Hope Feature, such as the guardian’s\n“Frontline Tank” or the wizard’s “Not This Time,” that\nunderscores their class archetype and showcases their power.\nYou can spend 3 Hope to activate these powerful abilities.\nIf you find yourself maxing out on Hope, using your Hope\nFeature could give you the upper hand—but remember to look\nfor opportunities to use Hope to help your allies and utilize\nyour Experiences. You will be gaining Hope regularly, and it’s\nmeant to be used often.\n90 \tChapter 2: Core Mechanics\n\n-- 91 of 415 --\n\nUSING FEAR\nAs a player, rolling with Fear doesn’t mean your action roll\nfails. Instead, you face a complication or consequence. For\nexample, your character learns only some of the information\nthey need, suffers a counterattack from the adversary they\njust struck, or encounters an unexpected danger or hazard.\nIf you fail the action roll where you rolled with Fear, those\nconsequences or complications are worse.\nWhen you roll with Fear, you don’t record it on your character\nsheet. Instead, the GM gains a Fear and makes a move to\nreflect the complications of your Fear roll. The GM can spend\nthe Fear they gain on effects such as spotlighting an adversary\nor making Fear moves (see the “Spending Fear” section on\npage 154).\nEVASION\nYour Evasion represents your character’s ability to avoid\nattacks and other unwanted effects from adversaries. This\nvalue sets the Difficulty for any roll a creature makes against\nyou. Your base Evasion is determined by your class, but it\ncan be modified by domain cards, equipment, conditions,\nand more.\nYou get to describe what your character’s Evasion represents,\nflavoring it the same way you describe their actions. Take\nthis opportunity to be creative, lean into the descriptions,\nand deepen your character. When an adversary misses them\nwith an attack or other effect, they might deftly avoid it with\nacrobatic dodging or precise footwork or disrupt the attack\nwith well-timed parries. They might even have a magical shield\nor enchanted object that wards off blows.\nAlthough these descriptions add to your character and\nthe story your group is telling together, they don’t change\nthe normal Evasion rules or give you special bonuses. For\nexample, you might describe how your character uses a\npowerful burst of magic to redirect an arrow headed their way,\nbut this doesn’t mean you can redirect the arrow back at the\nattacker and deal the damage to them instead.\nHIT POINTS AND DAMAGE\nTHRESHOLDS\nHit Points (HP) represent the physical injuries and\ndiscomforts your character experiences during their\nadventures. Your available Hit Points are determined by your\nclass. When you take damage—usually when an adversary\nsucceeds on an attack roll against your Evasion —you mark\nbetween 1 and 3 HP, representing the harm your character\nsuffers.\nThe number of HP you mark is determined by your damage\nthresholds. The threshold bar in the “Damage & Health”\nsection of your character sheet (and at the top right of this\npage) show the three thresholds of damage you can take:\nMinor, Major, and Severe.\nA character’s level is added to their armor’s damage\nthresholds to determine their final damage thresholds. For\nexample, a level 1 guardian wearing chainmail armor (with\nthresholds of 7/15) would start with the following thresholds.\n(See the “Using Armor” section on page 114 for more details.)\nDAMAGE & HEALTH\nMark 1 HP \tMark 2 HP \tMark 3 HP\nSTRESS\nhp\nMINOR\nDamage\nmajor\nDamage\nsevere\nDamage\nAdd your current level to your damage thresholds.\nMARKING HIT POINTS\nWhen the GM tells you to take damage, compare the damage\ntotal to your thresholds and mark a number of Hit Points\ndetermined by the threshold:\n• Severe damage is equal to or above your Severe threshold;\nyou mark 3 HP.\n• Major damage is equal to or above your Major threshold\nbut below Severe; you mark 2 HP.\n• Minor damage is anything below your Major threshold;\nyou mark 1 HP.\nIf you ever reduce incoming damage to 0 or less (typically by\nusing a subclass or domain card), you don’t mark any HP.\nWhen you mark your last Hit Point, you must make a death\nmove (see the “Death” section on page 106).\nExample: Using the example above, if a guardian’s incoming\ndamage is 16 or higher, the damage is Severe and they\nmark 3 Hit Points. If the damage is 8 or higher (but\nbelow 16), the damage is Major and they mark 2 Hit Points.\nIf the damage is below their Major threshold of 8, the\ndamage is Minor and they mark 1 Hit Point.\nCLEARING HIT POINTS\nAny time you make a downtime move (see the “Downtime”\nsection on page 105), you have the opportunity to clear some\nof your marked Hit Points.\nAdditionally, as your character levels up, you can choose to\npermanently increase their number of Hit Points, making them\nmore resilient against incoming attacks.\nOPTIONAL RULE: MASSIVE DAMAGE\nTo make the game more dangerous, your table can\nimplement a Massive threshold. If you ever take damage\nequal to double your Severe threshold, you mark\n4 Hit Points.\nExample: Using the example above, if the guardian takes 32\ndamage or more, they take Massive damage and mark 4 Hit\nPoints.\n8 \t16\n91\tChapter 2: Core Mechanics\n\n-- 92 of 415 --\n\nSTRESS\nStress represents the mental and physical strain your\ncharacter suffers during their adventures. Some features, such\nas your spells or abilities, might require you to mark a Stress\nto use them. Additionally, the GM might offer you the chance\nto mark a Stress in exchange for succeeding at the action\nyou’re taking. When you mark this Stress, consider the burden\nyour character knowingly accepts. Does their anxiety increase\nas they use a new tactic in a high-stakes negotiation? Do they\nwillingly dive back into danger and witness unimaginable\nhorrors, knowing the toll it takes on them, to save an innocent\nlife? Are they willing to take minor abrasions to fatally wound\ntheir foe?\nMARKING STRESS\nWhen an effect requires you to mark a Stress, do so on the\nslots on your character sheet. When you mark your last\nStress, you become Vulnerable (see the “Conditions” section\non page 102) until you clear at least 1 Stress.\nIf you’re ever forced to mark 1 or more Stress but your slots\nare already full, you must instead mark 1 Hit Point. For\nexample, if an adversary forces you to mark 3 Stress but your\nStress is already filled, you instead mark 1 Hit Point. If you\nwould take 2 Stress from an enemy and you have 1 Stress left,\nyou would mark 1 Stress and 1 Hit Point.\nAs with Hit Points, when you make downtime moves (see the\n“Downtime” section on page 105), you have the opportunity\nto clear some of your marked Stress. Additionally, as your\ncharacter levels up, you can choose to permanently increase\nthe amount of Stress they can withstand.\nStress from Adversaries\nSome adversary actions require you to mark Stress. These\nactions represent the adversary’s ability to demoralize your\ncharacter, exhaust them, or similarly push their physical and\nmental limits.\nStress from Complications\nYour GM can tell you to mark Stress to represent a\ncomplication or consequence of an action, especially when a\nroll doesn’t go as well as it could have. For example, you might\nmark Stress while having a difficult conversation, clashing\nswords with a worthy foe, or committing an act of incredible\nbravery. The GM might also allow you to mark Stress to avoid\na different complication.\nStress from Moves\nCertain moves require you to mark Stress. Unless an effect\nstates otherwise, you can’t mark Stress multiple times on\nthe same feature to increase or repeat its effects (see the\n“Spending Resources” section on page 107).\nYou can’t use a move that requires you to mark Stress if you\ndon’t have slots to mark.\nACTION ROLLS\nIn each scene, the GM and players go back and forth\ndescribing what happens. If you make a move where the\noutcome is in question, and the success or failure of that move\nis interesting to the story, your move is an action and the GM\ncalls for an action roll to determine the outcome. However,\nif an action is either easy to pull off without complication or\nimpossible to perform, there’s no need to roll—you already\nknow the result!\nWhen the GM (or your spell, attack, or ability) asks you\nto make an action roll, you’ll do so by rolling your Duality\nDice. Each action roll follows four basic steps, which are\nsummarized here and detailed in the sections that follow:\nSTEP 1:\nPICK A CHARACTER TRAIT.\nThe GM tells you which character trait best applies to\nthe roll and sets a Difficulty for the roll (either openly or\nprivately, at their discretion) based on the details of the\nscene.\nSTEP 2:\nADD EXTRA DICE AND\nMODIFIERS.\nYou decide if any Experiences or other modifiers\nalso apply, and grab character tokens, advantage or\ndisadvantage dice, and other dice as needed.\nSTEP 3:\nROLL THE DICE.\nYou roll your Duality Dice and any additional dice, then\nadd up the result of the dice and the tokens. Tell the GM\nthe total and which Duality Die rolled higher (“I got a 15\nwith Fear!”).\nSTEP 4:\nRESOLVE THE SITUATION.\nYou and the GM work together to\nresolve the outcome of your action.\n92 \tChapter 2: Core Mechanics\n\n-- 93 of 415 --\n\nSTEP 1:\nPICK A CHARACTER TRAIT\nSome actions require a certain character trait. In more\nflexible situations, depending on the scenario and how you’ve\ndescribed what you’re trying to do, the GM might tell you\nwhich trait to use. Other times, the GM might ask you for\nmore information to help decide: “You want to convince this\nguard to let you through. How are you speaking to them? Are\nyou intimidating them? Tricking them?”\nSometimes, more than one trait makes sense. In this case,\nthe GM might ask you which trait best fits your intent, offer\nyou a choice between two, or make a judgment call based on\nthe situation at hand. “As you inform him about the important\nmessage you have for the king, I need you to make a roll to\ndetermine if he believes your lie. I’d say Presence is probably\nwhat best applies. Does that sound right to you?”\nUnless your action requires a certain trait, feel free to suggest\none and describe why it’s a good match for what you’re doing.\nHowever, the GM always has final say over which trait applies.\nRoll Difficulty\nWhen you make an action roll, the roll will have a Difficulty—\nthe number you need to reach or exceed when you roll. Often,\nthe GM sets the roll’s Difficulty based on the situation and\nhow effective your approach might be. Some features provide\nthis Difficulty in parentheses after the listed roll, such as an\nAgility Roll (13) or a Spellcast Roll (10). If you’re making an\naction roll against an adversary, the Difficulty is found in their\nstat block.\nThe GM can choose whether to share the Difficulty of an\naction or not. Even if they don’t tell you the Difficulty, they\nshould make any potential consequences of your actions clear\n(unless the consequences aren’t something your character\nwould reasonably know). For example, “You’re putting yourself\nin melee with this guard, so you might take a hit in return,” or “If\nyou fail this jump, you might not make it to the other side.”\nSTEP 2:\nADD EXTRA DICE AND\nMODIFIERS\nOnce you know which character trait to use, it’s time to figure\nout if any other dice or modifiers apply to the roll, such as\nthe following:\nDuality Dice: You roll your Hope Die and Fear Die for\nevery action roll.\nAdvantage or Disadvantage: If you have advantage\nor disadvantage on the roll (see the “Advantage and\nDisadvantage” section on page 100), set aside that\nd6. If you’re rolling with disadvantage, make sure your\ndisadvantage die is a distinct color, so you can remember\nwhich die to subtract from the result.\nFeatures: Some features allow you to add additional dice to\nyour roll (or allow another character to give you a die). For\nexample, a bard can give you a Rally Die, which you can add\nto an action, reaction, or damage roll of your choice. Set\nthese dice aside for your roll.\nOther Dice: Occasionally, other effects (like a PC helping\nyou with the action) might give you additional dice.\nThen count the modifiers that apply to your action roll, setting\naside that many character tokens to help you keep track.\nModifiers can include the following:\nChosen Trait: Add or subtract the value of the trait you and\nyour GM chose for this roll as the modifier.\nExperience: If you have an Experience (or several) that you\nthink applies to the situation, describe how your Experience\nhelps your chance of success, then spend a Hope per\nExperience to add its modifier to your roll. The GM might\nask you for more information to justify that Experience,\nbut you have final say (within reason) over whether your\nExperience applies.\nClass Features, Subclass Cards, and Domain Cards:\nSometimes class features, subclass cards, and domain\ncards add a modifier to your roll, so keep an eye on your\ncharacter sheet and cards.\nOther Bonuses or Penalties: Add or subtract bonuses or\npenalties from your equipment, items, or other sources.\nTip: If you consistently use the same Experience on every\nroll, the GM will likely ask you to narrow the scope of that\nExperience or change it altogether. Experiences are meant to\nreflect the way your character has specialized in something\nimportant, not give you a bonus to all your actions.\nCounting Character Tokens\nOnce you declare what modifiers you’re applying to your\naction roll, grab that many character tokens.\nTokens aren’t dice; they’re counters you add to your hand to\nhelp total your results. Before you roll, total the sum of all of\nyour modifiers and grab that many tokens. For example, if\nyou have a −1 to Agility and a +2 modifier from an Experience\nyou’re utilizing, you have a +1 total modifier to the roll, so set\naside 1 token to represent that.\nTip: Occasionally, your total modifier on a roll can be\nnegative. In this case, you can still use tokens, but they’ll\nsignify the number you need to subtract from the result,\nrather than add. If you’d like, you can use a token of a\ndifferent color to indicate when your other tokens represent\na negative modifier.\n93\tChapter 2: Core Mechanics\n\n-- 94 of 415 --\n\nSTEP 3:\nROLL THE DICE\nOnce you’ve gathered your dice and tokens from step 2,\nroll the dice at the same time. Add the results together (and\nsubtract your disadvantage die, if necessary). Then, counting\neach token as 1, add or subtract your tokens to get the\nfinal result.\nTell the GM the total number you rolled and which Duality\nDie rolled higher (“I rolled a 12 with Hope!”).\nADDING BONUSES TO ROLLS\nSome features give you (or another player) a bonus to your\naction rolls, damage rolls, or reaction rolls. Unless otherwise\nspecified, all bonuses must be added before you make the roll.\nFor example, if a bard gives you a Rally Die, you must choose\nto use it before you roll, rather than after you see the results.\nSTEP 4:\nRESOLVE THE SITUATION\nIf your total meets or exceeds the Difficulty, the action\nsucceeds—you get what you want. If the total is below the\nDifficulty, the action fails—you don’t get what you want—but\nwith one exception! As described in the earlier “Duality Dice”\nsection, if your Duality Dice both roll the same number, you\ncritically succeed, even if your total wasn’t enough to meet\nthe Difficulty.\nBased on the result of your roll, the GM uses the following\nguidelines to decide how the narrative moves forward:\nON A CRITICAL SUCCESS…\nYou get what you want and a little extra. You gain a Hope\nand clear a Stress. If you made an attack roll, you also\ndeal extra damage (see the “Calculating Damage”\nsection on page 98).\nON A SUCCESS WITH HOPE…\nYou pull it off well and get what you want. You gain a Hope.\nON A SUCCESS WITH FEAR…\nYou get what you want, but it comes with a cost or\nconsequence. The GM gains a Fear.\nON A FAILURE WITH HOPE…\nThings don’t go to plan. You probably don’t get what you\nwant and there are consequences, but you gain a Hope.\nON A FAILURE WITH FEAR…\nThings go very badly. You probably don’t get what you\nwant, and a major consequence or complication occurs\nbecause of it. The GM gains a Fear.\nAfter you announce the result of your roll, the GM describes\nwhat happens next. The “Making Moves” section on page 149\nprovides GM guidance for resolving action rolls and making\nmoves.\n94 \tChapter 2: Core Mechanics\n\n-- 95 of 415 --\n\nEXAMPLE ACTION ROLL\nAliyah’s warrior Tabby is trying to run across a narrow parapet\nto stop a mage who is raining spellfire down on her party. The\nGM, Stella, tells Aliyah to make an Agility Roll with a Difficulty\nof 15. Tabby has a +2 Agility, so Aliyah rolls the Duality Dice,\nadds them together, then adds 2 tokens (representing her\n+2 modifier from Agility) to get her total.\nHere are examples of the five possible results of her roll:\nFAILURE WITH FEAR\nAliyah rolls 3 on the Hope Die and 6 on the Fear Die, then adds\n2 from her Agility for a result of 11 with Fear. 11 is below the\nroll’s Difficulty. Stella gains Fear and, because play passes\nback to her on a failure, describes the mage making an attack\nroll in response to Tabby’s maneuver. The attack is successful,\nso the mage knocks her off the parapet with a blast of magical\nfire and deals damage. Tabby crashes down to the ground\nbelow and must find a way back up if she plans to face the\nmage head-on again.\nFAILURE WITH HOPE\nAliyah rolls 6 on the Hope Die and 3 on the Fear Die, then adds\n2 from her Agility. That’s an 11 with Hope. A total of 11 isn’t\nenough to make it across safely, so on a failure, Stella makes a\nmove, narrating that the mage sees Tabby coming and makes\nan attack, which succeeds. The mage’s blast knocks Tabby off-\nbalance, leaving her dangling from the parapet, her progress\nstalled and position precarious. Tabby gains a Hope, but her\nfriends are still in the line of fire and might need to help her\nreach safety.\nSUCCESS WITH FEAR\nAliyah rolls 5 on the Hope Die and a 9 on the Fear Die,\nthen adds 2 from her Agility. That’s a 16 with Fear, so it’s a\nsuccess. Stella gains Fear, then asks Aliyah to describe how\nshe races across the parapet, dodging the mage’s blasts.\nAfter her description, Stella takes over, saying that once\nTabby has crossed, she faces her foe head-on, blocking them\nfrom attacking the rest of the party. But as the consequence\nfor a result with Fear—the mage reaches out with magic\nand crumbles the parapet behind Tabby, leaving her trapped\nand unable to move back to safety. At least the mage isn’t\nattacking her friends, right?\nSUCCESS WITH HOPE\nAliyah rolls 10 on the Hope Die and 6 on the Fear Die, then\nadds 2 from her Agility. That’s an 18 with Hope, so it’s a\nsuccess. She immediately gains a Hope, then Stella asks\nher to describe what it looks like as Tabby races across the\nparapet and interrupts the mage’s assault on the party. Since\nAliyah rolled a success with Hope, Stella asks what the players\nwant to do next.\nCRITICAL SUCCESS\nAliyah rolls 8 on the Hope Die and 8 on the Fear Die. That’s a\ncritical success! Tabby immediately gains a Hope and clears\na Stress. Stella offers Aliyah a choice of two extra benefits—\nshe can deal damage to the mage or gain advantage on the\nnext roll against the mage. Aliyah describes how Tabby races\nacross the parapet and lands a solid blow on the mage, not\njust stopping their attacks on the party, but dealing weapon\ndamage as well. Since a critical success counts as a roll with\nHope, Stella asks the players what they want to do next.\nSTORY IS CONSEQUENCE\nIn Daggerheart, every time you roll the dice, the scene\nchanges in some way. There is no such thing as a roll where\nnothing happens, because the fiction constantly evolves based\non the successes and failures of the characters. A failure\ndoesn’t mean you simply don’t get what you want, especially\nif that would result in a moment of inaction. The game is more\ninteresting when every action the players take yields an active\noutcome—something that develops the situation they’re in.\nFor example, if you fail a roll to pick a lock, it’s not just that the\ndoor doesn’t open. On a failure with Hope, it might mean you\ncan hear the rumble of footsteps coming down the hall behind\nyou—the adversaries you previously escaped are getting\nclose, and you have to hide, or find another way through. On a\nfailure with Fear, the door might’ve been magically warded to\nkeep thieves away, and its arcane alarm triggers. Meanwhile,\non a success with Fear, you might succeed in unlocking the\ndoor, but you’re spotted by the adversaries within. These\nconsequences are what make the game interesting and drive\nforward your shared adventure.\nEvery GM and player has a different level of interest and\ncomfort in this roll-by-roll improvisation. Some groups might\nprefer a largely predetermined world—for example, the GM\ncould have previously decided there are two guards on patrol,\nand you roll simply to learn whether you unwittingly run into\nboth of them, whether one rounds the corner but you catch\nthem unawares, or whether you escape both guards without\nnotice. In other groups, the GM might not have decided if there\nare guards at all—but after you roll a failure with Fear, the they\nquickly weave two guards into the story. Either approach is\nokay, and you’ll likely use a mix of both in each session!\n95\tChapter 2: Core Mechanics\n\n-- 96 of 415 --\n\nSPECIAL ACTION ROLLS\nMany action rolls use the rules in the previous section.\nHowever, some situations require special types of action rolls,\nwhich are detailed in the following sections.\nTRAIT ROLLS\nA trait roll is an action roll that calls for a specific character\ntrait to be used. These rolls often appear on domain cards\nand say something like “Presence Roll” or “Agility Roll (12).”\nIf there is a number in parentheses after the trait, that is\nthe Difficulty you must meet to succeed on the roll. If there\nis no number, the Difficulty is set by the GM based on the\ncircumstances. You can add your Experiences and other\nbonuses to a trait roll.\nIf a feature affects a roll that uses a certain trait (such as an\nAgility Roll), it affects any roll that uses that trait (such as a\nSpellcast Roll or attack roll that uses Agility). For example, the\nkatari’s ancestry feature “Feline Instincts,” which allows the\nkatari to reroll an Agility Roll, can be used both on an Agility\nRoll to traverse dangerous terrain and on an attack roll made\nwith a weapon that uses Agility.\nATTACK ROLLS\nWhen you make an action roll with the intent to harm an\nadversary, you’re making an attack roll. Reference the weapon\nor spell you’re using for the attack to determine what trait it\nuses. We’ll talk more about Spellcast Rolls in the next section,\nbut for a standard physical or magic weapon attack, use the\ncharacter trait the weapon requires (see the “Equipment”\nsection on page 112), as well as any applicable Experiences or\nother modifiers, and resolve it as you would a normal action roll.\nIf you succeed, make a damage roll to determine how much\ndamage the target takes.\nBy default, each attack roll can only target one adversary. If\na spell or ability allows you to target multiple adversaries, roll\nonce and apply that result to all of the adversaries the attack\ncan hit, unless otherwise specified. The attack is successful\nagainst all targets for which the attack roll result meets or\nexceeds their Difficulty.\nUNARMED ATTACK ROLLS\nWhen your character makes an attack without a weapon—\nfor example, a punch or a kick—you make an attack roll using\nStrength or Finesse (though the GM might allow you to use\nanother trait depending on how you describe the attack). On a\nsuccess, you deal d4 physical damage using your Proficiency.\nSPELLCAST ROLLS\nSpellcast Rolls are a type of action roll used when you’re\ncreating significant magical effects (typically with a domain\ncard). To make a Spellcast Roll, your character must have a\nsubclass that gives you a Spellcast trait (which you can find\non the subclass foundation card). You use that trait when you\nmake a Spellcast Roll. Like other trait rolls, Spellcast Rolls can\nhave a set Difficulty, such as “Spellcast Roll (14).”\nIf a Spellcast Roll can damage a target, it’s also considered an\nattack roll.\nYou can’t make a Spellcast Roll unless you use a spell that\ncalls for one, and the action you’re trying to perform must be\nwithin the scope of the spell. You can’t just make up magic\neffects that aren’t on your character sheet or cards. However,\nat the GM’s discretion, they might allow you to creatively\napply an existing spell in an unusual way. Remember that you\ncan always flavor your magic to match the character you’re\nplaying, but that flavor won’t give you access to new effects.\nExample 1: A sorcerer is trying to reach a cliff high above\nhim and doesn’t have a spell or ability that lets him get\nthere. He can’t make a generic Spellcast Roll to have magic\nlift him up into the air and fly him to the cliff; he needs a\nspecific spell or ability to accomplish this task.\nExample 2: To explain why their “Rune Circle” spell gives\nthem protection from adversaries, a wizard wants to flavor\nthat spell as an eruption of sparks from their wand that\nforms a galloping stallion circling around them. That’s\nawesome and should be highly encouraged, but if dealing\nextra damage to an adversary because of this narration falls\noutside the scope of the spell.\nWhen you cast a spell, the text tells you when the effect\nexpires. It might be temporary (in which case the GM can\nspend Fear to end the spell), it might end at the next rest, or\nit might have another duration. If the spell doesn’t note an\nexpiration, you choose when to end it, or it ends when the\nstory changes in a way that would naturally stop the effect. If\nyou ever want to end a spell earlier than its normal expiration,\nyou can always choose to do so. Unless the spell says\notherwise, you can cast and maintain the effects of more\nthan one spell at the same time.\n96 \tChapter 2: Core Mechanics\n\n-- 97 of 415 --\n\nGROUP ACTION ROLLS\nWhen multiple characters take action together—such as\nsneaking through an adversary’s camp as a group—the party\nnominates one character to lead the action (typically the\ncharacter with the highest bonus to the most applicable skill).\nEach player then describes how their character collaborates\non the task. The action’s leader makes an action roll as usual,\nwhile the other players make a reaction roll using whichever\ntraits they and the GM decide fit best (see the upcoming\n“Reaction Rolls” section). They can use different traits for their\nreaction rolls if they wish.\nThe leader’s action roll gains a +1 bonus for each reaction roll\nthat succeeds and a −1 penalty for each reaction roll that fails.\nTip: If you want to assist an individual ally with an action,\nyou can use Help an Ally instead (see page 90).\nExample: The party has just retrieved a stolen amulet from\nan ancient stronghold, and they are rushing out as the\nstructure collapses around them.\nThe GM calls for a group action roll as they try to escape.\nThe group elects Tabby the warrior to be the leader, since\nthat character would best remember the path to the exit.\nThe other characters each explain how they work with the\nparty to escape:\nShepherd the druid says they are running alongside Tabby\nto act as a second set of eyes in case there’s a faster route.\nThe GM calls for an Instinct Reaction Roll. It’s a 19, a\nsuccess, so they give Tabby an additional +1 bonus. The\nGM asks Shepherd to describe the shortcut they notice that\nallows for a quicker escape.\nRune the wizard says that he wants to understand what\nkind of magic caused the collapse and potentially reverse it.\nThe GM calls for a Knowledge Reaction Roll. It’s a 12, which\nisn’t quite enough, giving Tabby a −1 penalty. The GM asks\nRune what causes him to fall behind for a moment.\nLavelle the rogue says he notices that Rune looks like he’s\nnot going to make it, so he turns back to reach out a hand\nin a moment of desperation, yelling, “I’ve got you! We’re not\nleaving you behind!” The GM calls for a Presence Reaction\nRoll. It’s a 16—a success—giving Tabby a +1 bonus. The\nGM asks Lavelle and Rune to describe how this rescue\nhappens successfully.\nNow that everyone else has acted, Tabby takes the total of\nthe modifiers, in this case +1, and makes an Agility Roll,\nhoping to lead the party to safety while dodging debris and\npointing out hazards. She rolls a 16 with Fear. The GM\ngains a Fear and says that each character must mark a\nStress—but they also emerge from the stronghold just in\nthe nick of time, the ancient stones collapsing behind them.\nTAG TEAM ROLLS\nOnce per session, each player can choose to spend 3 Hope\nand initiate a Tag Team Roll between their character and\nanother PC. When you do, work with the other character’s\nplayer to describe how you combine your actions in a unique\nand exciting way. You both make separate action rolls, but\nbefore resolving the roll’s outcome, choose one of the rolls\nto apply for both of your results. On a roll with Hope, all PCs\ninvolved gain a Hope. On a roll with Fear, the GM gains a Fear\nfor each PC involved.\nTag Team Rolls are especially powerful on attack rolls. When\nyou and a partner succeed on a Tag Team Roll attack, you\nboth roll damage and add the totals together to determine the\ndamage dealt. If the attacks deal different types of damage\n(physical or magic), you choose which type to deal.\nA Tag Team Roll counts as a single action roll for the purposes\nof any countdowns or features that track action rolls.\nTip: Though you can only initiate one Tag Team Roll per\nsession, you can be involved in multiple Tag Team Rolls. For\nexample, you might spend 3 Hope to initiate a Tag Team Roll\nwith a partner, and the same partner can later spend 3 Hope\nto initiate one with you.\n97\tChapter 2: Core Mechanics\n\n-- 98 of 415 --\n\nDAMAGE ROLLS\nWhen you succeed on an attack roll against an adversary, you\nthen make a damage roll to determine how much damage\nyour attack deals, and thus how many Hit Points your target\nmust mark. A damage roll is composed of two parts: your\nProficiency and damage dice.\nPROFICIENCY\nYour Proficiency reflects how skilled you are at wielding\nweapons. You start at 1 Proficiency and can increase this\nvalue to a maximum of 6 over the course of a campaign. Your\nProficiency determines how many damage dice you roll on\na successful attack with a weapon, though other abilities or\nspells use Proficiency as well. This value is not weapon-specific,\nand does not change or reset when you equip a new weapon.\nTip: The effects of a spell or an ability might allow you to\nincrease your Proficiency beyond the maximum of 6.\nDAMAGE DICE\nThe damage dice used to make a damage roll are determined\nby the weapon, spell, or ability you’re using to make the\nattack. If the attack uses a weapon, you roll a number of your\nweapon’s damage dice equal to your Proficiency. You can find\nyour weapon’s damage dice in the “Active Weapons” section of\nyour character sheet. If the attack is coming from a spell on a\ndomain card or class feature, the text tells you which damage\ndice you should roll.\nAny time a move tells you to deal damage using your\nProficiency, you roll a number of dice equal to your\nProficiency. Any time it tells you to deal damage using\nyour Spellcast trait, you roll a number of dice equal to your\nSpellcast trait.\nExample: Aliyah's character Tabby has an ability that deals\nd8 damage using her Proficiency, which is 2. She rolls 2d8\nwhen dealing damage. Miles's character Rune has a spell\nthat deals d6 damage using his Spellcast trait, which is 3.\nHe rolls 3d6 when dealing damage.\nAs with action rolls, if you want to add a bonus to your\ndamage roll, you must decide to do so before you roll.\nCALCULATING DAMAGE\nAfter rolling your damage dice, add their values together, then\nadd any modifiers to determine the result. The GM marks Hit\nPoints based on that damage.\nTip: In Daggerheart, there’s a difference between damage\nand Hit Points. Damage is the result of your damage roll,\nincluding your damage dice and modifiers. Hit Points reflect\nhow hard that damage affects the creature who’s taking\nit. The number of Hit Points a creature marks depends on\nfactors such as their damage thresholds, armor, resistances,\nand immunities.\nDAMAGE WITHOUT MODIFIERS\nSome damage rolls tell you to roll a certain number and type\nof die without any modifiers. For example, “1d8 physical\ndamage.” In this case, you simply roll as indicated and the\nresult of that roll is the amount of damage you deal.\nExample: Aliyah makes an attack roll with her warrior’s\nbroadsword and gets a 15, which is a success. Her Damage\nProficiency is 2 and her broadsword’s damage dice are d8s,\nso she rolls 2d8 and gets a 3 and a 7, for 10 total damage.\nDAMAGE WITH MODIFIERS\nSome damage rolls come with modifiers, such as “2d6+2”\nor “3d8+5.” In these cases, you roll the dice, add their values\ntogether, then add the modifier to that total. This modifier is\nnot affected by your Proficiency.\nExample: Nolan makes a successful attack with his\nimproved shortbow, which deals d6+6 damage. He has a\nProficiency of 3, so he rolls 3d6. The results are 3, 5, and 6,\ntotaling 14. He then adds the modifier of +6, for a total of\n20 physical damage to the target.\nCRITICAL SUCCESSES AND DAMAGE\nIf your attack roll critically succeeds, your attack deals extra\ndamage! Start with the highest possible value the damage dice\ncan roll, and then make a damage roll as usual, adding it to\nthat value.\nExample: Miles’s character Rune makes an attack against\na target with his wand and rolls two 7s on the Duality\nDice—a critical success. Rune has a Proficiency of 2, and\nthe wand deals d6+1 magic damage, so Miles starts with\nthe maximum possible roll of 2d6, for a total of 12 damage.\nThen, he rolls the 2d6 and they land on a 4 and 5, totaling\n9. Finally, he adds the +1 modifier for a total of 22 magic\ndamage.\nMULTIPLE SOURCES OF DAMAGE\nWhenever damage would be applied more than once to a\ncreature during a PC’s move, the damage is always totaled\nbefore it’s applied to the adversary’s damage thresholds.\nFor example, if a PC with orc ancestry makes a successful\nattack against a target in Melee range and decides to spend a\nHope to use their “Tusks” feature (which gives them an extra\n1d6 damage on a damage roll), they would roll their normal\nweapon damage and add a d6 to the result, then deal that\ntotal damage to the adversary.\nIf this orc then decided—with the table’s consent—to keep\nthe spotlight and make another attack, this is considered a\nseparate move. When this attack resolves, its total damage is\ncounted separately from the damage of the orc's first move.\n98 \tChapter 2: Core Mechanics\n\n-- 99 of 415 --\n\nDAMAGE TYPES AND RESISTANCE\nSometimes other circumstances affect how much damage a\ncreature takes. Use the following rules to determine whether\nspecial circumstances affect a damage roll.\nDAMAGE TYPES\nWeapons, spells, and abilities deal one of two damage\ntypes: physical damage (phy) or magic damage (mag). Some\nmechanics interact with damage types to affect how damage\nis dealt or received—for example, a spell might double\nmagic damage, a condition might make a character resistant\nto physical damage, or an adversary might be immune to a\ndamage type altogether.\n• Physical damage is dealt through mundane physical\nblows, usually without the aid of magic. Most standard\nblades and bows deal physical damage.\n• Magic damage is dealt through magical means. Most\nharmful spells deal magic damage.\nDIRECT DAMAGE\nDirect damage is physical or magic damage that Armor Slots\ncan’t be used to reduce. For example, if a character is Poisoned\nby a creature's attack, they might take 1d10 direct physical\ndamage each time they act, which their Armor Slots can't be\nused to reduce.\nRESISTANCE AND IMMUNITY\nSome abilities, spells, items, and other effects grant resistance\nthat reduces damage, or immunity that prevents it. If the text\ndoesn’t specify whether resistance or immunity applies to\nphysical or magic damage, the effect applies to both.\nWhen a creature has resistance to a damage type, they halve\ndamage of that type before comparing it to their damage\nthresholds. For example, when your character deals 26\nphysical damage to a creature with physical resistance, the\ncreature only takes 13 physical damage.\nIf multiple features grant the same kind of resistance, they\nonly count as one source of resistance. For example, if two\ndifferent spells both provide a character resistance to physical\ndamage, incoming damage is still only halved.\nWhen a creature has immunity to a damage type, they do not\ntake any damage from an attack that deals damage of that type.\nIf your character has resistance or immunity plus another way\nto reduce damage (such as marking an Armor Slot), apply the\nresistance or immunity first. You can then use other methods\nto reduce the damage further. If an attack deals both\nphysical and magic damage, you can only benefit\nfrom resistance or immunity if you are resistant\nor immune to both damage types.\nREACTION ROLLS\nSome moves prompt a reaction roll. This is a roll in response\nto an attack or a hazard, representing your effort to avoid or\nwithstand the effect.\nReaction rolls work similarly to action rolls, except they don’t\ngenerate Hope, Fear, or additional GM moves. Additionally,\nother characters can’t help you on a reaction roll—every\nsecond counts, so you'll have to handle this alone!\nWhen you make a reaction roll, the GM tells you what trait to\nuse, then you make a roll with the Duality Dice as if it were an\naction roll. As with action rolls, if you want to add a bonus to\nyour reaction roll, you must decide to do so before you roll.\nAn effect requiring a reaction roll often says something like:\n“The target must succeed on an Agility Reaction Roll (14) or\ntake 3d12 physical damage.” In this case, if the target fails\nto meet or exceed the Difficulty of 14, they take the damage\nfrom the effect.\nExample: The GM describes a mage’s explosive spell\nhurtling toward Nolan’s rogue Lavelle, then asks Nolan to\nmake a reaction roll using Agility. Nolan rolls his Duality\nDice, adds his Agility, and gets a 19, beating the assigned\nDifficulty of 16. It’s a success! The GM asks Nolan to\ndescribe how Lavelle avoids the attack.\nIf you critically succeed on a reaction roll, you don’t clear\na Stress or gain a Hope, but you do ignore any effects that\nwould still impact you on a success (such as taking damage or\nmarking Stress).\nAdversaries also make reaction rolls, though they follow\nslightly different rules (see the “Adversary Reaction Rolls”\nsection on page 161).\n99\t99\tChapter 2: Core Mechanics\n\n-- 100 of 415 --\n\nADVANTAGE AND DISADVANTAGE\nSome features let you roll with advantage or disadvantage on\nan action or reaction roll.\nAdvantage represents an opportunity that you seize to\nincrease your chances of success. When you roll with\nadvantage, you add a d6 advantage die to your total.\nDisadvantage represents an additional difficulty, hardship,\nor challenge you face when attempting an action. When\nyou roll with disadvantage, you subtract a d6 disadvantage\ndie from your total.\nSome of your abilities might automatically grant you\nadvantage or impose disadvantage on adversaries, but the GM\ncan also choose to give you advantage or disadvantage on any\nroll when it fits the story. Unique rules for advantage come\ninto play when an ally is helping you with a roll, so see the\nearlier “Help an Ally” section on page 90 for more information.\nAdvantage and disadvantage always cancel each other out\nwhen applied to the same roll, so you’ll never roll both at the\nsame time. For example, if the GM gives you disadvantage\non a roll but you gain advantage from a domain ability, the\ntwo cancel each other out and the roll is made without a d6\nadvantage or disadvantage die. In this way, if you have two\nsources of advantage and one of disadvantage, one of the\nadvantage dice and the disadvantage die cancel each other\nout, so you would have advantage on the roll.\nNPCs can also roll with advantage (or disadvantage), but\nwhen they do, the GM rolls an additional d20 and picks the\nhighest (or lowest) result (see the “Giving Advantage and\nDisadvantage” section on page 160).\nTip: Some moves or effects require you to add or subtract\na d6 for reasons other than advantage or disadvantage. If\nyou find yourself both adding and subtracting a d6 for any\nreason, roll neither, since they cancel each other out.\nBATTLING ADVERSARIES\nThe flow of combat in Daggerheart is malleable and driven by\nthe dice. The player characters pass the spotlight between\nthemselves, making moves until someone fails a roll or rolls\nwith Fear, or until the GM spends a Fear to interrupt the\nplayers’ turns. When play passes to the GM, the GM can make\na move to spotlight an adversary—and, if they wish, can\nspend any number of Fear to spotlight that many additional\nadversaries.\nA spotlighted adversary can take any action the fiction\ndemands of them, but most of the time, they’ll do one of\nthe following:\n• Move within Close range and make a standard attack.\n• Move within Close range and use an adversary action.\n• Clear a condition.\n• Sprint within Far or Very Far range on the battlefield.\nConditions and ranges are described in the upcoming\n“Conditions” and “Maps, Range, and Movement” sections,\nbut the following example provides a brief overview of what\nit looks like when the GM takes their turn. Once the GM has\nfinished, play passes back to the PCs.\nExample: After Quinn makes an attack roll with Fear\nfor their druid Shepherd, play moves to the GM. The\nGM spotlights a nearby adversary who is temporarily\nVulnerable, and describes them breaking free from the\nvines that are binding them to remove the Vulnerable\ncondition. The GM has 6 Fear available, so they spend\n1 to spotlight the adversary Shepherd just hit with their\nshortstaff. The GM describes the adversary pulling their\nwarhammer out of the mud and swinging at Shepherd’s\nribs. The adversary succeeds on the attack, then rolls for\ndamage and totals it for 9 physical damage. This damage\nfalls above Shepherd’s Major threshold, but Quinn marks\nan Armor Slot and reduces the damage by one tier to Minor\ninstead, marking 1 Hit Point.\nSpending another Fear to shift the spotlight again, the GM\ndescribes an additional adversary sprinting all the way\nacross the battlefield to get to the massive bell that would\nsignal reinforcements. As the adversary prepares to ring it,\nthe GM returns play to the players, asking, “What do you\nwant to do?”\n100 \tChapter 2: Core Mechanics\n\n-- 101 of 415 --\n\nDOMAIN CARDS\nAs introduced in the “Domains” section of chapter 1, your\nactive domain cards grant you special abilities or spells.\nUnless a domain card states otherwise, you can use it as many\ntimes as you wish, for as long as it remains in your loadout.\nLOADOUT AND VAULT\nYou can have a maximum of five active domain cards in\nyour loadout at any one time. Your subclass, ancestry, and\ncommunity cards don’t count toward that limit and are always\nactive. At lower levels, you won’t have enough cards that\nyou need to make selections, but once you have six or more\ndomain cards, you need to choose which to keep in your\nloadout and which to store in your vault.\nCards in your loadout can be held in your hand, placed on the\ntable next to your character sheet, or made accessible through\nother means. Do whatever makes it easiest to use them. Any\ncards in your loadout are considered active, and you’re free to\nuse them during play.\nYour vault holds any domain cards that are inactive and\nnot currently in your loadout. Vault cards should be kept\nsomewhere out of the way, but close enough that they’re\navailable if they need to be accessed during a session if you\nwant to swap them into your loadout. A few features require\nyou to permanently place a card in your vault. When this\nhappens, that card is removed from play. You can’t move\nsuch a card back into your loadout by any means, nor can you\nchoose it again when you gain a level.\nSWAPPING CARDS\nWhen you start a rest, you can swap cards between your\nloadout and your vault. You must do so before you use any\ndowntime moves. If you have fewer than five cards in your\nloadout, you can add cards from your vault to your loadout\nuntil you have five active cards.\nWhen you’re not resting, you can still swap cards into your\nloadout, but it’s stressful to do so! To immediately switch a\ncard from your vault to your loadout, mark a number of Stress\nequal to the vaulted card’s Recall Cost (located in the top right\nof the card next to the lightning bolt symbol). When you do,\nswitch it for another domain card in your loadout and place\nthat card into your vault. If you currently have fewer than five\ndomain cards in your loadout, you can pay the Recall Cost and\nplace a card from your vault into your loadout without trading\nout a card for it.\nSwapping When You Level Up\nIf your loadout is full when you level up and gain a new card,\nyou can immediately move one of your active cards into your\nvault and add the new card to your loadout at no cost.\nUSAGE LIMITS\nSome domain cards have an exhaustion limit that restricts\nhow often you can use that card (for example, once per long\nrest). If you use that card, you’ll need a way to remember that\nit’s temporarily unavailable. You might choose to take that\ncard out of your hand and place it face down on the table, turn\nit on its side or upside down, or any other method to remind\nyourself that you’ve already used it. If a card allows for a\ncertain number of uses, you could add a token to it each time\nyou activate it to keep track of how many times you’ve used it.\nADDING TOKENS TO CARDS\nA feature might ask you to add a number of tokens to a\ndomain card. When you do, put the card on the table, grab\nthe appropriate number of character tokens, and place them\non the card. These tokens are used to track certain effects,\nbut they don’t affect your ability to add tokens to your roll to\nrepresent your modifiers, or anything else you might need to\nuse them for. If you still have tokens on your card at the end\nof a session and aren't told to clear them, ensure you track\nthe number you have left to place back on that card at the\nbeginning of the next session.\nTip: Some spells or abilities remain in effect once you activate\nthem. Unless stated otherwise, this does not prevent you\nfrom activating another spell or ability—you can use two (or\nmore) at the same time.\nRecall Cost\nDomain\nLevel\n101\tChapter 2: Core Mechanics\n\n-- 102 of 415 --\n\nCONDITIONS\nSome features impose a condition on your character (or an\nadversary). These are effects that grant specific benefits or\ndrawbacks to the target they are applied to. Daggerheart\nhas three primary conditions—Hidden, Restrained, and\nVulnerable—which are explained in the following sections.\nSome features apply other unique conditions whose effects\nare detailed within the text of the feature. Unless otherwise\nnoted, the same condition can’t be stacked—applied more\nthan once—on one target.\nHIDDEN\nWhile you’re out of sight from all foes and they don’t know\nwhere you are, you gain the Hidden condition. While Hidden,\nany rolls against you have disadvantage. After an adversary\nmoves to where they would see you, you move into their line\nof sight, or you make an attack, you are no longer Hidden.\nExample: While scouting a temple to the Fallen Gods and\ninvestigating some large statues depicting ancient battles,\nRune hears footsteps coming. He declares that he’s going to\nduck behind the statues and wait for whoever's approaching\nto pass. The GM decides that the statues provide ample\ncover and doesn’t call for a roll. Rune is now considered\nHidden. The GM describes snippets of dialogue as two\ncultists walk right by Rune as he sticks to the shadows, then\nasks Rune what he wants to do next. If Rune had attacked\nthe cultists as they passed, he’d have lost the Hidden\ncondition after doing so.\nRESTRAINED\nWhen you gain the Restrained condition, you can’t move until\nthis condition is cleared, but you can still take actions from\nyour current position.\nVULNERABLE\nWhen you gain the Vulnerable condition, you’re in a difficult\nposition within the fiction. This might mean you’re knocked\nover, scrambling to keep your balance, caught off guard,\nmagically enfeebled, or anything else that makes sense in the\nscene. When a creature becomes Vulnerable, the players and\nGM should work together to describe narratively how that\nhappened. While you are Vulnerable, all rolls targeting you\nhave advantage.\nCLEARING CONDITIONS\nWhen an effect imposes a condition, it might say it is\n“temporary,” or only applies \"temporarily,\" the condition is\na temporary condition. You can make an action roll, with a\nDifficulty determined by the GM, to try clearing a temporary\ncondition, though the GM might have you clear it in another\nway. As always, this action roll should be described and\nnegotiated narratively. For example, if your character is\nVulnerable, you might describe how you leap through the fire\nthat’s trapped you, free your legs from the vines entangling\nthem, or use a canteen to wash noxious venom off your body.\nIf an adversary is affected by a temporary condition, the GM\ncan use their move to spotlight the adversary and show how\nthey clear the condition. This doesn’t require a roll but does\nuse that adversary’s spotlight. When it fits the story, the GM\nmight clear the condition in other ways instead.\nSpecial conditions are cleared only when specific\nrequirements are met, such as completing a certain action or\nusing an item. The requirements for clearing these conditions\nare stated in the text when the condition is applied. The GM\ncan offer alternative ways to clear these conditions at their\ndiscretion.\nENDING OTHER TEMPORARY EFFECTS\nSome effects aren’t a condition, but state that they are\ntemporary. They can be ended in the same way as temporary\nconditions. If you initiate the effect (for example, by using\nthe “Ranger’s Focus” class feature), the GM can end it by\nspotlighting the adversary and describing how they get rid\nof it. Conversely, if the GM initiates the effect (such as an\nadversary creating a temporary cloud of poisonous gas), you\ncan try to end it by making an appropriate action roll.\nCOUNTDOWNS\nSometimes the GM, or a specific mechanic, utilizes a\ncountdown. Countdowns are a way for the table to keep track\nof a coming event, which you do by setting a die to a certain\nvalue, then ticking that number down until it reaches 0.\nA countdown might tick down every time an action roll is\nmade, every time a PC rolls with Fear, during each downtime,\nor any other parameter (either set by the specific mechanics\nor by the GM to reflect the fiction). To learn more about\ncountdowns, see the “Countdowns” section on page 162.\n102 \tChapter 2: Core Mechanics\n\n-- 103 of 415 --\n\nMAPS, RANGE, AND MOVEMENT\nYou can play Daggerheart using theater of the mind or maps\nand miniatures. The following section assumes you are using a\nmap for combat.\nMAPS\nYour group might want to use maps to clarify positioning,\nshowcase an environment, or simply because you enjoy maps\nand miniatures. Maps can be as elaborate or as simple as\nyou like. When it’s time to use an area map, everyone places\ntheir miniatures on it. Use the range measurements discussed\nbelow as general reference when building out a map.\nRANGE\nDaggerheart measures most distance by range. Each range\nincludes an example of how you might quickly estimate\ndistance on a physical map on which 1 inch represents roughly\n5 feet. However, these ranges aren’t intended to be precisely\nmeasured during play. The suggested estimates are a quick\nguide for the GM to determine ranges during a scene, and\nthey might adjust the map as needed. The map should always\nadjust to capture the fiction, rather than the fiction changing\nto match the map.\nIf the table decides not to implement a map, you still use\nrange, but in a more abstract way. Distances are simply a part\nof the theater of the mind, and it’s up to the GM to decide\nroughly how far away everything is.\nMelee: Your character is within touching distance of the\ntarget. A PC can touch targets up to a few feet away from\nthem. Keep in mind that Melee range might be greater for\nespecially large NPCs.\nVery Close: Your character is very close to a target, able to\nsee their fine details, and can reach them within moments.\nThis is about 5–10 feet away. While in danger, a character\ncan move into Melee range with anything that’s within Very\nClose range of them as part of their action. Anything on a\nbattle map that is within the shortest length of a game card\n(2–3 inches) can usually be considered within Very Close\nrange.\nClose: Your character is close enough to a target to see\ntheir prominent details, such as across a room or in a\nneighboring market stall. This is about 10–30 feet away.\nWhile in danger, a character can move into Melee range\nwith anything that’s within Close range of them as part\nof their action. Anything on a battle map that is within the\nlength of a standard pen or pencil (5–6 inches) can usually be\nconsidered within Close range.\nFar: Your character is far enough away that they can see\nthe appearance of a target, but not in detail, such as across\na small battlefield or down a large corridor. This is about\n30–100 feet away. While a character is in danger, the GM\nmight call for them to make an Agility Roll to safely move\ninto Melee range with something that’s within Far range of\nthem. Anything on a battle map that is within the length of\nthe long edge of a standard piece of paper (11–12 inches)\ncan usually be considered within Far range.\nVery Far: Your character is very far away, such as across\na large battlefield or down a long street, and while they\nmight be able to see the shape of a person or object, they\nlikely can’t make out any details. This is about 100–300\nfeet away. While a character is in danger, the GM might call\nfor them to make an Agility Roll to safely move into Melee\nrange with something that’s within Very Far range of them.\nAnything on a battle map that is beyond Far range, but still\nwithin the bounds of the conflict or scene, can usually be\nconsidered within Very Far range.\nOut of Range: Anything beyond a character’s Very Far\nrange is Out of Range and usually can’t be targeted.\nTip: When specific distances are referenced in the game\n(such as a wall that is 30 feet high or a rope that is 50 feet\nlong) it is to give a sense of scale in the fiction. In this same\nway, you shouldn't feel restricted to using ranges when\ndescribing the world—just when the characters interact with\nit mechanically.\nUSING RANGE\nWhen a weapon, spell, ability, item, or other effect states a\nrange, this refers to its maximum range. Unless otherwise\nnoted, an effect can also be used at closer ranges. For\nexample, the shortstaff weapon has a Close range, so it can be\nused against a target within Close, Very Close, or Melee range.\nRange is always measured from the source of the effect (often\nthe attacker or caster), unless the feature says otherwise.\nThis means targets in any direction of your character within\nthe specified range can be hit. Some effects specify a certain\narea within their range, such as an effect that targets “all\nadversaries in front of you.” In that example, you choose\nwhich direction your character is facing, then target each\nadversary in a 180-degree field in front of them. If an effect\ntargets creatures in a line, then you target each adversary in\na straight line within the specified range. As with other rules\nin this game, use common sense when interpreting these\neffects—they’re there to support the story, not limit it.\nOther effects can move your character or a target from one\nrange to another, such as an effect that lets you “knock back\na target to Close range.” These effects typically clarify which\nrange band a target is moved to (you can always move them\ncloser by choice). But if the fiction doesn’t support it—for\nexample, if an adversary hits a wall and can’t be moved any\nfarther—then follow the fiction rather than the exact range.\nA map is just an approximation of the scene playing out in\neveryone’s head, so scale, distance, and details don’t need\nto be perfectly accurate. The map and the miniatures on it\nshould never limit the table’s imagination, only provide spatial\ncontext so everyone is on the same page.\nOPTIONAL RULE: DEFINED RANGES\nIf your table would rather operate with more precise\nrange rules, you can use a 1-inch grid battle map during\ncombat. If you do, use the following guidelines for play:\n• Melee: 1 square\n• Very Close: 3 squares\n• Close: 6 squares\n• Far: 12 squares\n• Very Far: 13+ squares\n• Out of Range: Off the battlemap\n103\tChapter 2: Core Mechanics\n\n-- 104 of 415 --\n\nMOVEMENT\nWhen you’re not in a dangerous, difficult, or time-sensitive\nsituation, you don’t need to worry about how fast you move.\nHowever, when you’re under pressure or in danger, the\nfollowing rules apply.\nMOVING CLOSE DURING ACTIONS\nWhen you make an action roll, you can also move to a location\nwithin Close range as part of that action. This location must\nbe somewhere your character could plausibly and easily reach\nwithin the narrative. If you want to move somewhere beyond\nyour Close range but within Far or Very Far range, or if you\nwant to reach an area that’s not easily accessible (such as\none that requires climbing, swimming, or jumping), use the\nfollowing rules.\nMOVING FAR OR MOVING AS YOUR\nPRIMARY ACTION\nIf you’re not already making an action roll, or if you want to\nmove farther than your Close range, you’ll need to succeed on\nan Agility Roll to safely reposition yourself. The GM sets this\nDifficulty depending on the situation. On a failure, you might\nonly be able to move some of that distance, the adversaries\nmight act before you can make it, or a hazard might prevent\nyou from moving at all.\nADVERSARY MOVEMENT\nWhen an adversary is in the spotlight and makes a move such\nas attacking a target or picking a lock, the GM can move them\nwithin their Close range as part of their action. For example,\nthe adversary can pick a lock to open a door and then move\nwithin their Close range toward a PC inside the room beyond.\nIf the GM wants to move the adversary somewhere beyond\ntheir Close range but within their Far or Very Far range, this\nuses their entire action, but the adversary doesn’t have to\nsucceed on an Agility Roll like a PC would.\nTARGETS AND GROUPS\nAn effect often asks you to choose a target within range. This\nmeans you choose a single creature to affect. When it makes\nsense in the story, you can ask the GM if you can target a\nsingle object in range, rather than an adversary, adjusting the\neffects as needed. If an effect allows for multiple targets, you\ncan choose any that fall within the parameters of the effect.\nTo affect a group of targets, those targets must be clumped\ntogether in an area within Very Close range of a point you\nchoose. You can always ask the GM if adversaries would be\nconsidered a group before you make a move. Regardless of\nthe number of targets, you only make one attack roll and\ncompare its result to the Difficulty of each eligible target to\ndetermine which creatures you succeed against. When your\nattack deals damage to more than one target, roll damage\nonce and apply the total to each target the attack succeeded\nagainst.\nCOVER, LINE OF SIGHT,\nAND DARKNESS\nSometimes during a fight, you might seek cover, such as\nby diving behind a small barricade or ducking behind a tree.\nWhen you take cover behind something that makes attacking\nyou more difficult (but not impossible), attack rolls against you\nare made with disadvantage.\nYou usually can’t be targeted if you’re entirely behind a\nsubstantial structure like a wall, even if you’re technically in\nrange of the attack. However, you might still be affected by\nnearby explosions or similar effects that target an area.\nSome effects require the target to be within your line of sight.\nYou have line of sight if you can see the target (though in some\nsituations, the GM might decide the effect can’t go through a\nglass window or similarly transparent object). For alternatives\nto this rule for blind characters, see the “Adjusting Abilities\nand Spells” section on page 82.\nDarkness can also make certain actions more challenging. The\nGM should reflect this by raising the Difficulty of action rolls or\nimposing disadvantage on rolls made by the PCs.\nGOLD\nGold tracks how much wealth you have collected on\nyour journey. You can spend it on things such as items,\nconsumables, and equipment. Some campaigns are more\nor less focused on gold as a reward, so check with your GM\nabout how much your game will prioritize gold. There are\nno set prices in this book for weapons, armor, and loot, so\nyou aren’t locked out of adding exciting equipment if you’re\nnot playing a gold-focused campaign. The GM determines\nequipment prices based on the amount of gold given out\nduring your sessions.\nGold is measured in handfuls, bags, and chests, with\n10 handfuls to 1 bag, and 10 bags to 1 chest. When you have\nmarked all of the slots in a category and you gain another\ngold reward in that category, you mark a slot in the following\ncategory and clear all the slots in the current one. For\nexample, if you have 9 handfuls and gain another, you instead\nmark 1 bag and erase all handfuls. If you have 9 bags and\ngain another, you mark 1 chest and erase all bags. If you ever\nhave more than 1 chest, you’ll need to store some of your gold\nbefore you can take more.\nThe value of gold is abstracted so you don’t need to track it\nprecisely. If you want to tip a coin to a waiter or flip a coin into\na well, you don’t need to worry about it.\nOPTIONAL RULE: GOLD COINS\nIf your group wants to track gold more granularly, you\ncan add coins as your lowest denomination. Following the\nestablished pattern, 10 coins equal 1 handful.\n104 \tChapter 2: Core Mechanics\n\n-- 105 of 415 --\n\nDOWNTIME\nA party can choose to rest before they continue forward on\ntheir journey, and when they do, each PC has the chance\nto make two downtime moves. Though downtime is their\nchance to recover from the dangers they’ve faced, it’s also\nan opportunity for characters to have important, emotional\nscenes with each other—to learn more about one another\nin their quiet moments together and have character-centric\nconversations they might not have had time for during big\nbattles or high-intensity exploits.\nWhen the characters decide they want to have downtime, they\nchoose between a short rest and a long rest. A party can take\nup to three short rests before their next rest must be a long\nrest. If a short rest is interrupted (such as by an adversary's\nattack), characters don’t gain its benefits. If a long rest is\ninterrupted, the characters instead gain the benefits of a short\nrest (even if they’ve already had three short rests).\nSHORT REST\nA short rest is when the characters stop to catch their breath,\ntaking a break for about an hour. Each player can swap any\ndomain cards in their loadout for cards in their vault, then\nchoose two of the following moves (or choose the same move\ntwice). Some short rest downtime moves require you to use\nyour tier as a value. This is covered in the upcoming “Tiers of\nPlay” section.\nTend to Wounds: Describe how you hastily patch yourself\nup, then clear a number of Hit Points equal to 1d4 + your\ntier. You can do this to an ally instead.\nClear Stress: Describe how you blow off steam or pull\nyourself together, then clear a number of Stress equal to\n1d4 + your tier.\nRepair Armor: Describe how you quickly repair your armor,\nthen clear a number of Armor Slots equal to 1d4 + your tier.\nYou can do this to an ally’s armor instead.\nPrepare: Describe how you prepare yourself for the path\nahead, then gain a Hope. If you choose to Prepare with one\nor more members of your party, you each gain 2 Hope.\nLONG REST\nA long rest is when the characters make camp, relax for a few\nhours, and get some rest. Each player can swap any domain\ncards in their loadout for cards in their vault, then can choose\ntwo of the following moves (or choose the same move twice).\nTend to All Wounds: Describe how you patch yourself up,\nthen clear all Hit Points. You can do this to an ally instead.\nClear All Stress: Describe how you blow off steam or pull\nyourself together, then clear all Stress.\nRepair All Armor: Describe how you spend time repairing\nyour armor, then clear all Armor Slots. You can do this to an\nally’s armor instead.\nPrepare: Describe how you prepare for the next day’s\nadventure, then gain a Hope. If you choose to Prepare with\none or more members of your party, you each gain 2 Hope.\nWork on a Project: Establish or continue work on a project\n(see the following “Working on a Project in Downtime”\nsection).\nWORKING ON A PROJECT IN DOWNTIME\nIf a PC wants to pursue a project that would take them a\nsubstantial amount of time but that they can work on during a\nlong rest, they should first discuss it with the GM. This could\ninvolve deciphering an ancient text, crafting a new weapon,\nor something similar. Projects usually involve a Progress\nCountdown (see the “Countdowns” section on page 162).\nEach time a PC takes the Work on a Project downtime move\nduring a long rest, they either automatically tick down their\ncountdown, or the GM might ask them to make an action roll\nto gauge their progress.\nFor more information on projects, see the “Using Downtime”\nsection on page 181.\nDOWNTIME CONSEQUENCES\nDowntime allows for quiet scenes between characters,\nencouraging personal moments in the story—but the world\ndoesn’t stop when you rest! The GM also takes actions during\ndowntime. On a short rest, they gain 1d4 Fear. On a long rest,\nthey gain an amount of Fear equal to 1d4 + the number of\nPCs, and they can advance a long-term countdown.\nREFRESHING FEATURES DURING DOWNTIME\nResting can refresh the availability of your features and end\nsome temporary effects.\n• Any effects that last until your next rest end when your\ncharacter finishes either a long or a short rest. Likewise,\nany features that can be used a number of times per rest\nrefresh when your character finishes either a long or a\nshort rest.\n• Any effects that last until your next long rest end when\nyour character finishes a long rest. Likewise, any features\nthat can be used a number of times per long rest only\nrefresh when your character finishes a long rest.\nONCE PER SESSION FEATURES\nSome features say you can use them “once per session.”\nThese features don’t refresh during rests, but instead are\navailable again at the start of your next Daggerheart session.\nIf your table decides to play a long session, the GM might\ndecide that all “once per session” abilities are refreshed during\na break in play instead.\n105\tChapter 2: Core Mechanics\n\n-- 106 of 415 --\n\nDEATH\nFacing death is an important part of being an adventurer and having a character die can be an exciting end to a story, as well as\nan opportunity for the player to transition into something new. In Daggerheart, when you mark your last Hit Point, you must\nmake a death move.\nDEATH MOVE\nChoose one of the following options:\nBlaze of Glory: Your character embraces death and goes out in\na blaze of glory. Take one action (at the GM’s discretion), which\ncritically succeeds, then cross through the veil of death.\nAvoid Death: Your character avoids death and faces the\nconsequences. They temporarily drop unconscious, and then\nyou work with the GM to describe how the situation worsens.\nYour character can’t move or act while unconscious, they can’t\nbe targeted by an attack, and they return to consciousness\nwhen an ally clears 1 or more of their marked Hit Points or\nwhen the party finishes a long rest. After your character falls\nunconscious, roll your Hope Die. If its value is equal to or\nunder your character’s level, they gain a scar (see the following\n“Scars” section).\nRisk It All: Roll your Duality Dice. If the Hope Die is higher,\nyour character stays on their feet and clears an amount of\nHit Points or Stress equal to the value of the Hope Die (divide\nthe Hope Die value between Hit Points and Stress however\nyou’d prefer). If the Fear Die is higher, your character crosses\nthrough the veil of death. If you critically succeed, your\ncharacter stays up and clears all Hit Points and Stress.\nIf a player makes a death move that results in their character\ndying, they should work with the GM before the next session to\nbuild a new character at the current level of the rest of the party.\nSCARS\nIf you choose to avoid death, you might take a scar. If you do,\ncross out one of your Hope slots. You can’t use this slot anymore.\nThe narrative impact of this scar is up to you. For example, you\nmight now bear a physical scar, a painful memory, or a deep fear.\nScars are permanent, but can be healed at the GM's discretion as\na downtime project, a reward for a quest focused on healing that\nscar, or something with similar narrative weight.\nIf you ever cross out your last Hope slot, it’s time to end your\ncharacter’s journey. Work with the GM to find a fitting way for\nthe party to say goodbye to them at the end of the session, then\nprepare a new character at the current level of the rest of the\nparty for the next time you play.\nRESURRECTION\nIt is possible to resurrect a dead character, though it’s often a\nlong, difficult, and costly process. If a party decides to take this\npath upon a character’s death, the GM details the steps the party\nmust take to complete the resurrection.\nThere is also the “Resurrection” spell available from the Splendor\ndomain at level 10.\n106 \tChapter 2: Core Mechanics\n\n-- 107 of 415 --\n\nAdditional Rules\nThe following rules apply to many aspects of the game.\nROUNDING UP\nThis game doesn’t use fractions; if you need to round to a\nwhole number, round up unless otherwise specified.\nREROLLING DICE\nWhen a feature allows you to reroll a die, you always take the\nnew result. You do not choose between the first result and the\nnew one, unless the feature specifically says that you can.\nINCOMING DAMAGE\nWhen a feature refers to incoming damage, it’s describing the\ndamage amount a target is currently receiving. For example,\nthe dwarves' “Increased Fortitude” feature allows a PC to\nspend 3 Hope to halve incoming physical damage. This means\nthat the GM tells the player how much damage their PC is\ntaking from an attack. The player can then decide to spend\n3 Hope to take half as much damage instead. If the player\nwanted to do this again on an additional attack, they’d need\nto spend another 3 Hope.\nSIMULTANEOUS AND STACKING EFFECTS\nIf two or more effects can apply to a situation, and the\nrules don’t tell you which order to apply them in, the player\ncontrolling the effects (including the GM) can apply the effects\nin any order. For example, if one ability lets you spend a Hope\nto retaliate after an attack, and another ability lets you gain a\nHope when you mark a Hit Point, you can decide to gain the\nHope first, then spend it to make the attack. Similarly, if you\nhave multiple moves that can trigger in a situation (such as\ntwo moves that occur “after a successful attack”), you can use\nthem together and choose in which order to activate them.\nIf you want to apply two or more effects, they must both be\nable to successfully resolve to be used together. Otherwise,\nyou must choose which one applies. For example, if you can\nclear a Stress every time you roll with Fear, and you have an\nability that lets you make a roll with Fear into a roll with Hope,\nyou can’t clear a Stress and then change the roll to be with\nHope instead of Fear. As always, if there’s any uncertainty, the\nGM arbitrates how effects apply.\nAt the GM’s discretion, most effects can stack. For example, if\ntwo bards give you a Rally Die, you can spend both of them on\nthe same roll. However, you can’t stack conditions, advantage\nor disadvantage, or other effects that say you can’t.\nONGOING SPELL EFFECTS\nOnce a spell's effect is in play, as long as it doesn’t mention an\nexpiration, it continues until a PC or the GM ends it, or until\nthe fiction changes in a way that would naturally stop it. This\nmeans that if you cast a spell and then switch out that domain\ncard for another in your vault, the spell’s effect can remain\nactive, even though that card is no longer in your loadout.\nSPENDING RESOURCES\nIf a rule tells you to spend a resource, you lose that resource\nonce you spend it. For example, when you spend a Hope on an\nability, you clear a Hope that you’ve marked on your character\nsheet. Similarly, if a bard gives you a Rally Die, when you\nchoose to spend it and add its result to your roll, you lose that\ndie and return it to the other player.\nUnless an effect states otherwise, you can’t spend Hope or\nmark Stress multiple times on the same feature to increase\nor repeat its effects on the same roll. For example, if a feature\nsays you can “spend a Hope to add 1d6 to the damage roll,”\nyou can’t spend 2 Hope and add 2d6 instead. If a feature says\n“mark a Stress to gain a +3 bonus to your Spellcast Roll,” you\ncan’t mark 2 Stress and gain a +6 bonus.\nHowever, on an effect like the Guardian’s Hope Feature,\nwhich says “Spend 3 Hope to clear 2 Armor Slots,” you can\nspend 6 Hope to clear 4 Armor Slots, because this effect isn’t\napplying its bonus to a specific roll—you’re just activating the\nfeature more than once.\nUSING FEATURES AFTER A ROLL\nSome features let you affect a roll after the result has been\ntotaled—such as the seraph’s “Prayer Dice,” the faerie’s\n“Wings,” or the Grace domain’s “Endless Charisma.” In this\ncase, you use it after the GM declares if the roll succeeds or\nfails, but before the narrative consequences unfold (such as\ndamage being rolled) or another dice roll is made.\nEND OF THE SCENE\nSometimes certain effects, bonuses, or conditions state that\nthey last until the end of the scene. At the GM’s discretion,\na scene continues until the current narrative situation has\nplayed out. A chase scene might end when the PCs have\ncaught their quarry or when they’ve escaped pursuit. A battle\nscene usually ends when one side has fled, surrendered, or\nbeen entirely defeated. If there’s uncertainty about when a\nscene is considered to be over, throw it to the table and see\nwhat the players think makes sense. You don’t have to linger in\na scene after the most engaging actions and interactions have\noccurred. If you want to play out their implications or process\nthe emotions but the heat of the moment has passed, that\naftermath can take place in its own scene.\n107\tChapter 2: Additional Rules\n\n-- 108 of 415 --\n\nPlayer Best Practices\nThis section provides guidance for player best practices and how to get\nthe most out of Daggerheart. When considering these best practices,\nremember the “Player Principles” section in this book’s introduction.\nEMBRACE DANGER\nThe life of an adventurer is a dangerous one, often filled with\ntreacherous paths, monstrous threats, and powerful foes.\nAlong the way, you’ll face difficult choices and life-threatening\nperil. It’s important as adventurers to embrace this danger\nas part of the game. Playing it safe, not taking risks, and\noverthinking a plan can often slow the game to a halt.\nDon’t be afraid to leap in headfirst and think like a storyteller,\nasking what the hero of a novel or a TV show would do here?\nThink about not only what choice might be obvious, but\nwhat story could be most interesting, or how your character\nmight approach the situation differently because of their\nbackground. Remember that you are not your character and\nthat it’s okay to put them into harm’s way, push them to their\nlimits, and take big risks if it’s right for the story. Their trials\nand their failures are not yours. We might always want to win,\nbut players win by collaborating on a compelling narrative, not\nby having successful dice rolls every time.\nUSE YOUR RESOURCES\nPlayer characters in Daggerheart have access to many\nresources that help them in their heroic journey. Chief among\nthem is Hope, a resource that frequently comes and goes over\nthe course of a session. You’ll gain a Hope roughly every other\ntime you make an action roll, so you’re encouraged to spend it\non Hope Features, to Help an Ally, to Utilize an Experience, to\ninitiate a Tag Team Roll, and to use other features and abilities\nthat cost Hope.\nStress, Hit Points, and Armor are your most essential\nother resources. They interact in varying ways that you can\nmanipulate and optimize with domain abilities, ancestry\nfeatures, class features, and more. For players excited about\nthe crunch of interacting mechanics, look to those resources\nand think about how to manage them to get the most out of\nyour character.\nTELL THE STORY\nYou are an equal partner in telling the story alongside\neveryone else at the table. The GM presents opportunities\nand challenges for the party along the way, but they are\nnot the sole author of the fiction you’re exploring together.\nDaggerheart is a collaborative game where everyone is\nresponsible for bringing the tone, feel, and themes they’re\ninterested in to the group. If you have an idea for a description\nor a detail to add, feel free to offer it to the table. If you want\na specific emotional arc to be a part of your story, talk to your\nGM about finding opportunities to include it, and seize those\nopportunities when they show up. When you reach these\nmoments in the story, take the time to showcase the emotions\ndriving your character forward and the desires spurring their\nactions.\nYour role as a player in Daggerheart is to guide your character\nalong the best story arc you can, not necessarily to always\nmake the most tactical or strategic moves. Think about what\nyou’re interested in saying thematically with the narrative, and\nlet that be expressed through your character.\nDISCOVER YOUR CHARACTER\nIt’s okay not to know everything about your character when\nyou sit down to play for the first time, the tenth time, or\neven the hundredth time. When the game begins, you only\nhave a few pieces of information to go on—such as what\nyour character might be good at, some backstory, their\nrelationships with a few other characters, and what kind of\nweapon they carry. That’s perfectly fine—because you’ll build\non your character throughout the game. Think of character\ncreation as an ongoing process. The GM might turn to you to\nask something about your past that you haven't worked out\nor thought of yet. You could take this opportunity to invent\nsomething on the spot, or ask them to talk through some\nideas with you before you settle on one. Try to use the game’s\nfiction to discover the different aspects of your character, and\nlet those discoveries flow into the decisions they make.\n→ Embrace danger.\n→ Use your resources.\n→ Tell the story.\n→ Discover your character.\n108 \tChapter 2: Player Best Practices\n\n-- 109 of 415 --\n\nLeveling Up\nWhen your party reaches a milestone in a campaign, the GM will tell you that it’s time to level\nup. How often this happens is up to your GM and your group’s narrative preferences, but most\ngroups play at least three sessions between levels.\nOVERVIEW\nAll party members level up at the same time. When you level\nup your character, you can upgrade their character traits\nand features. The following sections provide step-by-step\ninstructions for leveling up a character.\nGenerally, characters begin their journey at level 1 and end their\njourney at level 10, but if a party loses a character in the middle\nof a campaign, the GM should have the character's player make\na new character at the appropriate level of the party.\nTIERS OF PLAY\nLevels in Daggerheart are divided into tiers.\n→ Tier 1 encompasses level 1 only.\n→ Tier 2 encompasses levels 2–4.\n→ Tier 3 encompasses levels 5–7.\n→ Tier 4 encompasses levels 8–10.\nYour tier affects your damage thresholds, level achievements,\nand more.\nLEVEL ACHIEVEMENTS\nWhen your character levels up, first take any level\nachievements they have earned. These achievements are\ngiven in at the top of the tier block, found on the lower half of\nyour class guide.\n• At level 2, you gain an additional Experience and add it to\nyour character sheet with a modifier of +2. You also gain a\npermanent +1 bonus to your Proficiency.\n• At level 5, you gain an additional Experience and add it to\nyour character sheet with a modifier of +2. You also gain\na permanent +1 bonus to your Proficiency. You clear any\nmarks on each character trait you’ve previously increased\nand marked, allowing you to increase those traits again\nlater.\n• At level 8, you gain an additional Experience and add it to\nyour character sheet with a modifier of +2. You also gain\na permanent +1 bonus to your Proficiency. You clear any\nmarks on each character trait you’ve previously increased\nand marked.\nTip: For help with Experiences, see the “Step 7: Create Your\nExperiences” section on page 20.\n109\t109\tChapter 2: Leveling Up\n\n-- 110 of 415 --\n\nCHOOSING ADVANCEMENTS\nNext, you have a set list of options for upgrading your character. You can choose any two options with unmarked slots. Some\noptions have multiple slots, meaning they can be chosen more than once. When you choose your advancement, mark the\nappropriate slot. Once all of an option’s slots have been marked, you can’t take that option again.\nTIER 4:,ū.ff.ūffi,5294\nAt level 8, gain an additional\nExperience at +2 and clear all marks\non character traits. Then gain a\n+1 bonus to your Proficiency.\nThen work with the GM to generate two starting Experiences for your character.\nTier 3: LEVELS 5–7\nAt level 5, gain an additional\nExperience at +2 and clear all marks\non character traits. Then gain a\n+1 bonus to your Proficiency.\nTier 2: LEVELS 2–4\nAt level 2, gain an additional\nExperience at +2 and gain a\n+1 bonus to your Proficiency.\nWhat do I do that annoys you?\nWhy do you grab my hand at night?\tYou’ve always looked up to another bard.\nWho are they, and why do you idolize them?\nYou were in love once. Who did you adore, and how did they hurt you?\nChoose two options from the list below or any from\nthe previous tier and mark them.\nGain a +1 bonus to two unmarked character\ntraits and mark them.\nPermanently gain one Hit Point slot.\nPermanently gain one Stress slot.\nPermanently gain a +1 bonus to two\nExperiences.\nChoose an additional domain card of your\nlevel or lower from a domain you have\naccess to (up to level 7).\nPermanently gain a +1 bonus to your Evasion.\nTake an upgraded subclass card. Then cross\nout the multiclass option for this tier.\nIncrease your Proficiency by +1.\nMulticlass: Choose an additional class for\nyour character, then cross out an unused\n“Take an upgraded subclass card” and the\nother multiclass option on this sheet.\nUpdate your level and adjust your damage\nthresholds accordingly. Take an additional domain\ncard of your level or lower from a domain you\nhave access to.\nChoose two options from the list below or any from\nthe previous tier and mark them.\nGain a +1 bonus to two unmarked character\ntraits and mark them.\nPermanently gain one Hit Point slot.\nPermanently gain one Stress slot.\nPermanently gain a +1 bonus to two\nExperiences.\nChoose an additional domain card of your\nlevel or lower from a domain you have\naccess to.\nPermanently gain a +1 bonus to your Evasion.\nTake an upgraded subclass card. Then\ncross out the multiclass option for this tier.\nIncrease your Proficiency by +1.\nMulticlass: Choose an additional class for\nyour character, then cross out an unused\n“Take an upgraded subclass card” and the\nother multiclass option on this sheet.\nUpdate your level and adjust your damage\nthresholds accordingly. Take an additional domain\ncard of your level or lower from a domain you\nhave access to.\nChoose two options from the list below and\nmark them.\nGain a +1 bonus to two unmarked character\ntraits and mark them.\nPermanently gain one Hit Point slot.\nPermanently gain one Stress slot.\nPermanently gain a +1 bonus to two\nExperiences.\nChoose an additional domain card of your\nlevel or lower from a domain you have\naccess to (up to level 4).\nPermanently gain a +1 bonus to your Evasion.\nUpdate your level and adjust your damage\nthresholds accordingly. Take an additional domain\ncard of your level or lower from a domain you\nhave access to.\n• When you choose to increase two unmarked character\ntraits and mark them: Choose two unmarked character\ntraits and gain a permanent +1 bonus to them. You can’t\nincrease these stats again until the next tier (when your\nlevel achievement allows you to clear those marks).\n• When you choose to permanently add 1 or more Hit Point\nslots: Darken the outline of the next rectangle in the\nHit Point section of your character sheet in pen or\npermanent marker.\n• When you choose to permanently add 1 or more Stress\nslots: Darken the outline of the next rectangle in the\nStress section of your character sheet in pen or\npermanent marker.\n• When you choose to increase an Experience: Choose\nan Experience on your character sheet and gain a\npermanent +1 bonus to it.\n• Take an additional domain card of your level or lower from\na domain you have access to: You can choose an additional\ndomain card from your class’s domains at your level or\nlower. If you have multiclassed, select a card from your\nchosen domain at no higher than half your level.\n• When you choose to increase your Evasion:\nGain a permanent +1 bonus to your Evasion.\n• When you choose to take an upgraded subclass card:\nTake the next card for your subclass. If you have only\nthe foundation card, take a specialization. If you have a\nspecialization already, take a mastery. You’ll also cross out\nthe option to multiclass when you subsequently level up in\nthat tier.\n• When you choose to increase your Proficiency: Fill in one\nof the open circles in the “Proficiency” section of your\ncharacter sheet, then increase your weapon’s number of\ndamage dice by 1 (for example, from 2d6 to 3d6). You’ll\nsee a black box around the level-up slots. That is because\nincreasing your Proficiency requires you to mark both\nlevel-up slots in order to take it as an option.\n• When you choose to multiclass: You can take certain\nfeatures and domain cards from another class. You’ll see\na black box around the level-up slots. That is because\nmulticlassing requires you to mark both level-up slots\nin order to take it as an option. See the upcoming\n“Multiclassing” section for details.\nagility\t\nMark Here\n110 \tChapter 2: Leveling Up\n\n-- 111 of 415 --\n\nRAISING DAMAGE THRESHOLDS\nAfter choosing advancements, raise your character’s damage\nthresholds by +1 (since you always add their current level to\ntheir damage thresholds).\nTAKING DOMAIN CARDS\nFinally, take a new domain deck card at your level or lower,\nincreasing the special abilities your character can use. You can\nchoose one card from any domain deck available to your class.\nIf you share a domain deck with another player, make sure\nyou take each other’s preferences into consideration when\nchoosing a card, or that you have multiple copies of a card\navailable.\nAdditionally, you can also choose to trade out one domain\ncard you already have for a different domain card of an equal\nlevel or lower.\nSince you can’t have more than five domain cards active at a\ntime, once you have six or more domain cards, you need to\nchoose which to keep in your loadout and which to store in\nyour vault.\nMULTICLASSING\nStarting at level 5, you can choose multiclassing as an option\nwhen leveling up. When you multiclass, you get to choose an\nadditional class, select one domain from that class, and gain\naccess to their class feature. Take the appropriate multiclass\nmodule and add it to the right side of your character sheet,\nthen choose a foundation card from a subclass of your\nchoice. If that foundation card has a Spellcast trait on it, you\ncan choose to use that trait when making a Spellcast Roll or\nuse the Spellcast trait from your original subclass. If you did\nnot previously have a Spellcast trait and now require one for\nyour multiclass, you must use the Spellcast trait noted on\nyour new subclass.\nTip: When you multiclass, you must cross out one available\n“take an upgraded subclass card” option on this tier of your\nlevel up sheet, meaning you can’t gain the mastery card\nfor any subclass. You also cross out any other multiclass\noptions, as characters can only multiclass once.\nChoose a domain from your new class that you don’t already\nhave access to. Moving forward, whenever you get to choose\ndomain cards, you can choose from cards that match your\nadditional domain at half your current level (rounded up). This\nmeans a level 5 wizard who decides to multiclass into druid\nand chooses the Sage domain could choose any Sage domain\ncards of level 3 or lower.\nAny attacks, spells, or other moves you use while\nmulticlassing are always performed at your current level. For\nexample, a level 7 wizard who multiclasses into a druid can\nuse the tier 3 “Beastform” options. If any move you get by\nmulticlassing asks you to use a number of dice equal to your\nlevel, use the level on your character sheet. The half-level\nrestriction only applies to selecting domain cards, not the\nmechanics written on them.\nEXAMPLE OF LEVELING UP\nA CHARACTER\nAliyah’s party has just advanced to level 2 and the group\nis leveling up together. Aliyah finds the warrior class guide\nto bring Tabby up to level 2.\n• First, Aliyah updates Tabby’s level to “2” at the top of\nher character sheet.\n• Aliyah then takes her level achievements. She adds\na new Experience for Tabby. Because Tabby has\nbeen doing a lot of acrobatics and daring jumps,\nshe decides to give her the Always Land on My Feet\nExperience. This is a new Experience, so it starts\nwith a +2 modifier. Afterward, she increases Tabby’s\nProficiency to 2 (because she gets a permanent +1\nbonus at level 2) and fills in one of the circles in the\nProficiency section of her character sheet to reflect\nthe change.\n• Next, she looks at the advancement options for levels\n2 to 4. She knows she wants to increase Tabby’s\nAgility, since that’s her primary trait for combat. She\nmarks “Gain a +1 bonus to two unmarked character\ntraits and mark them.” Aliyah chooses Agility and\nInstinct, raising each by 1 (Tabby now has an Agility\nof +3 and an Instinct of +2), then marks the circle\nattached to each trait as a reminder that they can’t be\nraised again until Tabby hits level 5 and clears marks\non all traits.\n• Following that, Aliyah marks “Permanently gain one\nStress slot.” She looks at the Stress section of Tabby’s\ncharacter sheet and fills in the outline of one of the\ndotted squares to represent Tabby’s new permanent\nStress slot. That means she'll be able to withstand\nmore strain during play.\n• She then goes to Tabby’s damage thresholds and\ngains a permanent +1 bonus to both from her level\nup, increasing her Major threshold from 7 to 8 and\nher Severe threshold from 14 to 15. Additionally,\nshe updates the damage bonus from her “Combat\nTraining” class feature to +2, as the bonus is equal to\nher level.\n• Lastly, Aliyah asks for the domain decks for Blade and\nBone to pick a new domain card at level 2 or lower. At\nlevel 2, her options in the Blade deck are “Reckless”\nand “A Soldier’s Bond.” Her choices from the Bone are\n“Strategic Approach” and “Ferocity.” Aliyah considers\nthe option to gain and give Hope with “A Soldier’s\nBond.” Since Tabby’s Knowledge trait is only 0, she\ndoesn't think “Strategic Approach” is a good choice.\nIn the end, she settles on “Reckless” to give Tabby a\nbetter chance of hitting her opponents.\nNow Tabby is ready to continue her journey as a\nlevel 2 warrior!\n111\tChapter 2: Leveling Up\n\n-- 112 of 415 --\n\nEquipment\nThis section details the rules for equipping and using weapons and armor, then lists the weapons\nand armor used in this game.\nEQUIPPING, STORING, AND\nSWITCHING EQUIPMENT\nYou equip weapons and armor to your character by recording\nthem on your character sheet in the “Active Weapons” and\n“Active Armor” sections. Your character can only attack with\nweapons, benefit from armor, and gain features from items\nthey have equipped.\nINVENTORY WEAPONS\nAs your character acquires new equipment throughout their\njourney, they can carry two additional weapons (primary,\nsecondary, or any combination of the two) in the “Inventory\nWeapon” areas of the character sheet, but there’s only so\nmuch room in your character’s pack. The inventory section\nholds gear your character doesn't have equipped, therefore\nyour character isn't wielding these items and will not gain their\nbenefits.\nSWITCHING WEAPONS\nWhen your character is in a dangerous situation, you can mark\na Stress to equip an Inventory Weapon, moving their previous\nActive Weapon into the Inventory Weapon section. If your\ncharacter is in a calm situation or preparing during a rest, they\ncan swap weapons with no Stress cost.\nSWITCHING ARMOR\nYour character can’t equip armor while in danger or under\npressure. Otherwise, they can equip armor freely, replacing\ntheir previous active armor with armor they’ve purchased\nor otherwise acquired. Each armor has its own Armor Slots,\nas recorded in the boxes in that section; if your character\nswitches armor, be sure to keep track of how many Armor\nSlots you’ve marked on the old armor, especially if you are\ngiving it to a party member. You can't carry additional armor in\nyour inventory.\nWhen your character switches armor, be sure to add their\ncurrent level to its base damage thresholds and incorporate\nany bonuses they might have from other features.\nUSING WEAPONS\nThe following sections detail the types of weapons found in\nDaggerheart, then break down their statistics. When you’re\nready to review the weapon options, see the “Primary Weapon\nTables” and “Secondary Weapon Tables” sections, which list\navailable weapons by tier.\nPRIMARY AND SECONDARY WEAPONS\nWeapons fall into two main categories: primary and\nsecondary.\nPrimary weapons are the main weapons your character will\nlikely be fighting with during an encounter. A character can\nonly hold one primary weapon at a time, which goes into\nthe “Primary Weapon” area of their character sheet. If you\ntake a two-handed weapon, this is typically the only weapon\nyour character can have active. The list of starting primary\nweapons, called Tier 1 primary weapons, can be found in the\nupcoming “Primary Weapon Tables” section on page 115.\nSecondary weapons are typically ancillary pieces of\nequipment that augment your character’s fighting, such as\nshields, daggers, or small swords. If a character's primary\nweapon is one-handed, we recommend you also take a\nsecondary weapon (but you can’t hold your secondary weapon\nif you switch to a primary weapon that requires two hands).\nYour character can only hold one secondary weapon at a\ntime, which goes in the “Secondary Weapon” area on their\ncharacter sheet. The list of starting secondary weapons, called\nTier 1 secondary weapons, can be found in the upcoming\n“Secondary Weapon Tables” section on page 124.\nYou can make an attack roll with either a primary or secondary\nweapon your character has equipped, allowing for flexibility in\nthe types of attacks you can make. Many secondary weapons\nhave features that augment another aspect of your character’s\nfighting style—for example, a dagger might grant them extra\ndamage to targets they attack with their primary weapon\nwithin Melee range, or a shield might add to your character’s\nArmor Score. Most adventurers choose to at least carry\na primary weapon, but for guidance on fighting without a\nweapon, see the “Unarmed Attack Rolls” section on page 96.\nTHROWING A WEAPON\nWhen you’re using a weapon that you could theoretically\nthrow (such as a dagger or an axe), you can throw it at a target\nwithin Very Close range, making an attack roll using Finesse.\nOn a success, deal damage as usual for that weapon. Once\nthrown, you lose that weapon. Unless you retrieve it, you can’t\nattack with it or benefit from its features.\n112 \tChapter 2: Equipment\n\n-- 113 of 415 --\n\nWEAPON STATISTICS\nEach weapon in this book includes its name, trait, range, damage die, damage type, and burden. Some weapons also have a\nfeature. For example, the broadsword starting weapon has the following statistics:\nName \tTrait \tRange \tDamage \tBurden \tFeature\nBroadsword \tAgility \tMelee \td8 phy \tOne-handed \tReliable: +1 to attack rolls\nNAME\nIn your character's early adventures, most weapon names\nare the same as their type. For starting weapons, this is often\nsomething straightforward, such as a battleaxe or hand runes.\nAs characters level up and collect better equipment, this\nname could become more specific—something like a flaming\ndragonscale blade, a valiant bow, or even a named weapon like\nthe Wand of Essek.\nTRAIT\nThis tells you what trait is used when making an attack with\nthis weapon. For example, a Strength weapon uses your\ncharacter’s Strength trait whenever they use it to attack a\ntarget.\nRANGE\nRange signifies the maximum distance from which a weapon\nor effect can hit a target. You can hit something in Melee, Very\nClose, Close, Far, or Very Far range with an effect or weapon.\nDAMAGE\nThe damage represents how deadly your weapon is against\nthe adversaries you face. When a weapon’s damage lists a\ntype of die—such as “d8”—you roll that die to determine the\ndamage you deal.\nAs your character levels up, they’ll increase their Proficiency,\nwhich starts at 1. Unless otherwise specified, you roll a\nnumber of damage dice equal to your character’s Proficiency.\nFor example, if your character’s Proficiency is 2 and their\ndamage die is a d8, you roll 2d8 and add their values\ntogether. If you roll a 4 and an 8 on these dice, you deal a\ntotal of 12 damage.\nDAMAGE TYPE\nA weapon’s damage type specifies what kind of damage\nit does to a target: physical (phy) or magic (mag). Physical\ndamage comes from any wielded weapon that cuts, stabs,\nor bludgeons (such as swords, longbows, and warhammers).\nMagic damage is caused or enhanced by magic (such as the\n“Conjure Swarm,” “Midnight Spirit,” and “Smite” spells).\nDamage types are important because some creatures might\nhave resistance or immunity to one of the two types. For\nexample, ghosts may not be as affected by physical damage\nas they are by magic damage.\nYou typically can’t wield weapons that deal magic damage\nunless you have a Spellcast trait.\nBURDEN\nA weapon’s burden notes how many hands it takes to wield\nit. Weapons are either one-handed or two-handed. When you\ntake a weapon, you’ll also fill up a number of hands equal to its\nburden on your character sheet. If your character can’t bear\nthe burden of a weapon because their hands are already full,\nyou can’t equip it.\nYou’re welcome to create a character with any number of\nhands or have your character wield a weapon using something\nother than their hands. However, when tracking burden,\neach character mechanically has two appendages capable of\nwielding weapons.\nFEATURE\nA weapon feature describes any special rules that apply only\nto that particular weapon. For example, some features reduce\nor increase your character’s statistics, while others give them\nspecial ways to deal damage. A weapon’s features only apply\nto that weapon; you can’t apply its features to a different\nweapon. Your character can only benefit from a weapon's\nfeatures while the weapon is equipped. If you put a weapon\ninto your inventory, lose it, or get rid of it, your character no\nlonger gains the benefits of that feature.\nArrows & Ammunition\nWe assume that if your character has a bow, they’re well supplied with standard arrows. If you have a gun, they're well supplied\nwith standard bullets of the applicable type. But if they've picked up specialized ammunition at some point, be prepared to keep\ntrack of this limited arsenal.\nTip: Your party might want to play a campaign that feels grounded or gritty. If so, you can monitor and limit the acquisition of\nsupplies such as food, ammunition, and other sundries. Have a discussion with your GM and table about the cost of goods and the\navailability of materials in your world.\n113\tChapter 2: Equipment\n\n-- 114 of 415 --\n\nUSING ARMOR\nEach armor in this book includes its name, base damage thresholds, and base Armor Score. Some armor also has a feature.\nFor example, the chainmail starting armor has the following statistics:\nName \tBase Thresholds \tBase Score \tFeature\nChainmail Armor \t7 / 15 \t4 \tHeavy: −1 to Evasion\nNAME\nIn your character's early adventures, most early armor names\nare the same as their type, such as chainmail armor. As your\ncharacter levels up, they might acquire special armor, such as\nveritas opal armor.\nBASE SCORE\nAn armor’s base score represents the short-term protection it\nprovides and how many Armor Slots you can mark (before any\nbonuses from other features). For example, if an armor’s base\nscore is 4, you have 4 available Armor Slots you can mark.\nYour character’s Armor Score, with all bonuses included, can\nnever exceed 12. Once you add all other bonuses to an armor’s\nbase score, the final total is referred to as your character’s\nArmor Score.\nBASE THRESHOLDS\nAn armor’s base damage thresholds represent the long-term\nprotection your armor provides, and determine your damage\nthresholds (before any bonuses from other features). When\nrecording your character’s damage thresholds in the “Damage\n& Health” section of your character sheet, you always add\nyour character’s level to those values. For example, if your\nlevel 1 character has base thresholds of 7/15 with no other\nbonuses, they would have a Major damage threshold of 8 and\na Severe damage threshold of 16.\nFEATURE\nArmor features describe any special rules that apply only to\nthat particular armor. For example, some reduce or increase\nyour character’s statistics, and others give you special ways\nto use your character’s Armor Slots. A set of armor's features\napply only to that specific armor; you can’t apply its features\nto different armor. Your character can benefit from a set of\narmor's features only while armor is equipped.\nREDUCING DAMAGE\nWhen your character takes damage, you can negate some\n(or all) of it by marking an available Armor Slot next to the\nlarge Armor shield on your character sheet, then reducing the\nseverity of the damage by one threshold (Severe to Major,\nMajor to Minor, Minor to Nothing). Each time your character\ntakes damage, you can only mark 1 Armor Slot (as long as you\nhave one available). Once all available Armor Slots are marked,\nyour character’s armor can’t be used again in this way until\nthey repair it, usually as a move during downtime.\nExample: Rune has an Armor Score of 3 and Miles, his\nplayer, has marked 1 Armor Slot already. If an adversary\nhits Rune for Major damage, Miles can mark an Armor\nSlot to reduce that to Minor instead. That puts him at 2\nmarked Armor Slots, so he can only mark 1 more Armor\nSlot before needing to repair his armor during downtime.\nIf your character has an Armor Score of 0, you can’t mark\nArmor Slots. If an effect gives your character a temporary\nArmor Score (such as the “Tava’s Armor” spell), you can mark\nthat many additional Armor Slots while the temporary armor\nis active. When the temporary armor ends, clear a number of\nArmor Slots equal to the temporary Armor Score.\nExample: Miles’s wizard Rune gains a +2 bonus to his\nArmor Score until his next rest. Miles changes Rune’s\nArmor Score to 5. At the start of his next short rest, he\nchanges Rune’s Armor Score back to 3 and clears 2 Armor\nSlots.\nUNARMORED\nGoing unarmored does not give your character any bonuses or\npenalties, but while unarmored, they have an Armor Score of\n0, their Major threshold is equal to their level, and their Severe\nthreshold is equal to twice their level.\nREFLAVORING ARMOR\nAs with weapons, class abilities, and domains, you can reflavor\nyour character’s armor to suit them. A wizard using full plate\narmor might describe their protection as coming from heavily\nenchanted robes and protective rings, while their penalty to\nEvasion and Agility is due to the intense focus required to\nmaintain such powerful protective magic.\narmor\n3\nX \tX\nArmor Score of 3 with 2 Armor Slots marked.\n114 \tChapter 2: Equipment\n\n-- 115 of 415 --\n\nprimary weapon tables\nPlayers can choose one Tier 1 primary weapon during character creation.\nThe GM can make other weapons available throughout the campaign as the PCs level up.\nTIER 1 (LEVEL 1)\nPhysical Weapons\nName \tTrait \tRange \tDamage \tBurden \tFeature\nBroadsword \tAgility \tMelee \td8 phy \tOne-Handed \tReliable: +1 to attack rolls\nLongsword \tAgility \tMelee \td8+3 phy \tTwo-Handed \t—\nBattleaxe \tStrength \tMelee \td10+3 phy \tTwo-Handed \t—\nGreatsword \tStrength \tMelee \td10+3 phy \tTwo-Handed\nMassive: −1 to Evasion;

This section provides\nmechanics and narrative guidance for you to work from, but\nfeel free to adapt the flavor text to best suit your character.\nHave fun with your character’s wheelchair design, and make it\nas unique or tailored to them as you please.\nACTION AND MOVEMENT\nWhen describing how your character moves, you can use\ndescriptions such as the following:\n• “I roll over to the door to see if it’s open.”\n• “I wheel myself over to the group to ask what’s going on.”\n• “I pull my brakes and skid to a halt, turning in my seat to\nlevel my bow at the intruder.”\nCONSEQUENCES\nHere are some ways you might describe complications you\nencounter when your character uses their wheelchair:\n• “I pull my brakes, but I don’t think to account for the loose\ngravel on the ground.”\n• “I hit a patch of ice awkwardly and am sent skidding out\npast my target.”\n• “I go to push off in pursuit, but one of my front caster\nwheels snags on a crack in the pavement, stalling me for a\nmoment.”\nGMs should avoid breaking a character's wheelchair or\notherwise removing it from play as a consequence, unless\neveryone at the table, especially the wheelchair user’s player,\ngives their approval.\nEVASION\nYour character is assumed to be skilled in moving their\nwheelchair and navigating numerous situations in it. As a\nresult, the only wheelchair that gives a penalty to a PC's\nEvasion is the Heavy Frame model.\nBURDEN\nAll wheelchairs can be maneuvered using one or two hands\noutside of combat. However, when being used as a weapon,\nthe chair is restricted to requiring one or two hands to\nperform attacks, depending on the model you’ve chosen.\nIf you’re playing a character who has limited to no mobility in\ntheir arms, their wheelchair can be attuned to them by magical\nmeans. For example, your character might use a psychic link\nto guide the chair around like a pseudo-electric wheelchair. All\nthe rules presented here can be tailored and adapted to any\ncharacter's needs.\nCHOOSING YOUR MODEL\nAll combat wheelchairs are equipped as Primary Weapons.\nThere are three models of wheelchair available: light, heavy,\nand arcane. You’re encouraged to consider the type of\ncharacter you’re playing and the class they belong to, then\nchoose the model that best matches that character concept.\n122 \tChapter 2: Primary Weapon Tables\n\n-- 123 of 415 --\n\nLight Frame Models\nThough tough, these wheelchairs have light frames that allow the chair to move with your character in more acrobatic ways.\nThese models are best suited to adventurers who rely on speed and flexibility.\nName \tTier \tTrait \tRange \tDamage \tBurden \tFeature\nLight-Frame\nWheelchair \t1 \tAgility \tMelee \td8 phy \tOne-Handed \tQuick: When you make an attack, you can mark\na Stress to target another creature within range.\nImproved\nLight-Frame\nWheelchair\n2 \tAgility \tMelee \td8+3 phy \tOne-Handed \tQuick: When you make an attack, you can mark\na Stress to target another creature within range.\nAdvanced\nLight-Frame\nWheelchair\n3 \tAgility \tMelee \td8+6 phy \tOne-Handed \tQuick: When you make an attack, you can mark\na Stress to target another creature within range.\nLegendary\nLight-Frame\nWheelchair\n4 \tAgility \tMelee \td8+9 phy \tOne-Handed \tQuick: When you make an attack, you can mark\na Stress to target another creature within range.\nHeavy Frame Models\nThese wheelchairs have bulky and heavier frames, allowing the chair to lend its weight to your character’s attacks.

Unlike other primary magic weapons, the arcane-frame model doesn’t specify a trait to use when making an attack\nwith it. Instead, you use the Spellcast trait indicated by your subclass.\nName \tTier \tTrait \tRange \tDamage \tBurden \tFeature\nArcane-Frame\nWheelchair \t1 \tSpellcast \tFar \td6 mag \tOne-Handed \tReliable: +1 to attack rolls\nImproved\nArcane-Frame\nWheelchair\n2 \tSpellcast \tFar \td6+3 mag \tOne-Handed \tReliable: +1 to attack rolls\nAdvanced\nArcane-Frame\nWheelchair\n3 \tSpellcast \tFar \td6+6 mag \tOne-Handed \tReliable: +1 to attack rolls\nLegendary\nArcane-Frame\nWheelchair\n4 \tSpellcast \tFar \td6+9 mag \tOne-Handed \tReliable: +1 to attack rolls\n123\tChapter 2: Primary Weapon Tables\n\n-- 124 of 415 --\n\nSecondary weapon tables\nPlayers can choose one Tier 1 secondary weapon during character creation.\nThe GM can make other weapons available throughout the campaign as the PCs level up.\nTIER 1 (LEVEL 1)\nName \tTrait \tRange \tDamage \tBurden \tFeature\nShortsword \tAgility \tMelee \td8 phy \tOne-Handed \tPaired: +2 to primary weapon damage to targets within\nMelee range\nRound Shield \tStrength \tMelee \td4 phy \tOne-Handed \tProtective: +1 to Armor Score\nTower Shield \tStrength \tMelee \td6 phy \tOne-Handed \tBarrier: +2 to Armor Score; −1 to Evasion\nSmall Dagger \tFinesse \tMelee \td8 phy \tOne-Handed \tPaired: +2 to primary weapon damage to targets within\nMelee range\nWhip \tPresence \tVery Close \td6 phy \tOne-Handed \tStartling: Mark a Stress to crack the whip and force all\nadversaries within Melee range back to Close range.\nGrappler \tFinesse \tClose \td6 phy \tOne-Handed \tHooked: On a successful attack, you can pull the target\ninto Melee range.\nHand\nCrossbow \tFinesse \tFar \td6+1 phy \tOne-Handed \t—\nTIER 2 (LEVELS 2–4)\nName \tTrait \tRange \tDamage \tBurden \tFeature\nImproved\nShortsword \tAgility \tMelee \td8+2 phy \tOne-Handed \tPaired: +3 to primary weapon damage to targets within\nMelee range\nImproved\nRound Shield \tStrength \tMelee \td4+2 phy \tOne-Handed \tProtective: +2 to Armor Score\nImproved\nTower Shield \tStrength \tMelee \td6+2 phy \tOne-Handed \tBarrier: +3 to Armor Score; −1 to Evasion\nImproved\nSmall Dagger \tFinesse \tMelee \td8+2 phy \tOne-Handed \tPaired: +3 to primary weapon damage to targets within\nMelee range\nImproved\nWhip \tPresence \tVery Close \td6+2 phy \tOne-Handed \tStartling: Mark a Stress to crack the whip and force all\nadversaries within Melee range back to Close range.\nImproved\nGrappler \tFinesse \tClose \td6+2 phy \tOne-Handed \tHooked: On a successful attack, you can pull the target\ninto Melee range.\nImproved\nHand\nCrossbow\nFinesse \tFar \td6+3 phy \tOne-Handed \t—\nSpiked\nShield \tStrength \tMelee \td6+2 phy \tOne-Handed \tDouble Duty: +1 to Armor Score; +1 to primary weapon\ndamage within Melee range\nParrying\nDagger \tFinesse \tMelee \td6+2 phy \tOne-Handed\nParry: When you are attacked, roll this weapon's damage\ndice.

For example, if you’re on\nthe battlefield preparing to run at an adversary and attack\nthem, you have a moment to drink a Stamina Potion before\nyou sprint toward them. But if you’re pinned in the jaws of a\nmassive Flickerfly and want to consume a Health Potion, the\nGM might rule that you need to make an action roll to drink it.\nMINOR STAMINA\nPOTION\nFEATHERBONE\nMINOR HEALTH\nPOTION\nVARIK LEAVES\nSTARDROP\n133\tChapter 2: Loot\n\n-- 134 of 415 --\n\nFULL EXAMPLE OF PLAY\nIn this full example of play, we join a party as they embark on a journey to Whitecrest Tower,\nrumored to be the home of a powerful artifact from an ancient battle.\nTHE PARTY:\n• Quinn (they/them), playing Shepherd (they/them),\nWildborne Infernis Warden of Renewal Druid\n• Miles (he/him), playing Rune (he/him), Ridgeborne\nDrakona School of War Wizard\n• Aliyah (she/her), playing Tabby (she/her), Underborne\nKatari Call of the Brave Warrior\n• Nolan (he/him), playing Lavelle (he/him), Slyborne Human\nNightwalker Rogue\nTHEIR GM:\n• Stella (she/her), who starts the scene with five Fear.\nSTELLA: “Whitecrest Tower is built into the side of a mountain,\nforcing attackers approaching from the valley below to make a\ndangerous climb. So my first question is—how do you want to\nget up to the tower?”\nQUINN: “I want to use ‘Nature’s Tongue’ and find a goat or ram\nor some other creature that lives on the mountains and ask them\nabout the easiest way up to the tower.”\nSTELLA: “Absolutely. It’s not hard to find some goats tromping\naround in seeming defiance of gravity. Give me that Instinct Roll,\nDifficulty 12.”\nQuinn rolls the Duality Dice and adds 2 tokens to represent\ntheir Instinct of +2. They roll a 7 on the Hope Die and a 4 on\nthe Fear Die.\nWith their 2 tokens, the final result is a 13 with Hope.\nQuinn adds a Hope to their sheet.\n“On a success with Hope, the goat is friendly enough and gives\nyou clear information. She remembers the pathway that the last\ngroup of two-legs took and leads you to it. Don’t forget to gain a\nHope.”\nQUINN: “I respond, ‘Thank you, goat friend.’ Then I fish out\nsome food from my pack and give it to her as she leads us up.”\nSTELLA:“The food disappears in an instant. Then the goat\nstarts scaling the mountain, leading you to the path. We’re going\nto do the ascent as a progress countdown, but since you’re\ngetting help, I’m going to set it at 3 instead of 5. What’s the next\nmove you make to scale the mountain?”\nALIYAH: “Tabby is going to take the lead and set pitons for the\nothers to help make the ascent easier for everyone.”\nSTELLA: “That sounds like an Agility Roll.”\nAliyah rolls a 2 on the Hope Die, but a 7 on the Fear Die.\nWith Tabby’s Agility of +3, that’s a total of 12 with Fear.\nALIYAH: “I’m going to use my ‘Feline Instincts’ as a katari to\nspend 2 Hope and reroll my Hope Die.\"\nShe spends the Hope and rolls the Hope Die again, getting\nan 8.\n“Nice! That’s an 18 with Hope.”\nSTELLA: “On a success with Hope, you tick down the\ncountdown by 2.” “It’s down to 1, so at this point, even a\nsuccess with Fear will get you to the tower. Gain a Hope. Tabby\nscales the mountain, neck and neck with the goat, setting\npitons and throwing rope down behind to help the others.\nYou’re making quick work, but there’s still another hundred feet\nbetween you and the top of the tower. What do you do?”\nMILES: “Oh, I want to try out my new grimoire. Rune takes\nsome rope and pitons, and then he’s going to cast ‘Arcane Door’\nto teleport up to the front gate so he can throw down the rope.”\nSTELLA: “Nice. That’s a Spellcast Roll with Difficulty 13, and\nyou spend a Hope to cast it.”\nMiles spends a Hope and rolls the Duality Dice, adding\n3 modifier tokens for his character’s Spellcast trait\n(Knowledge). He gets a 5 on the Hope Die and a 6 on the\nFear Die.\nMILES (slightly nervous): “That’s a 14, so a success…with\nFear.”\nStella gains a Fear, adding it to her pool.\nSTELLA: “You all see Rune disappear and then reappear\nhalfway up the remaining distance, then he blinks out again\nand appears by the front gate. With a rope leading all the way\nup, it’s relatively simple for the rest of you to make the climb\nunscathed.”\nQUINN: “I give the helpful goat another nibble of food before I\nsend her off to her own business.”\nSTELLA (nods): “Shepherd says farewell to the goat. But Rune,\nbehind you something shifts, like the wooden floors of an old\nhouse. But this doesn’t feel like settling. It feels like something\nwaking from slumber.”\nNOLAN (with an expression that suggests the opposite): “I’m\nsure that’s fine.”\nSTELLA: “Once you’ve all made it up the rope, you stand at the\nshattered front gate of Whitecrest Tower, the mountainside wall\ncollapsed and long since worn down by snow, rain, or avalanche.\nThe only sounds you hear are the whistling of wind through the\nruins as you pass the outer wall of Whitecrest Tower.”\n134 \tChapter 2: Full Example of Play\n\n-- 135 of 415 --\n\nSTELLA (CONT’D): Lavelle, your contact said that the surviving\ntreasure hunter she met last month made it as far as the\nbasement of the castle before the rest of her party was killed by\na Skeleton Knight.”\nNOLAN: “So we know to go down once we get inside. Let’s\nsneak in as far as we can before we catch the attention of\nwhatever’s already here.”\nSTELLA: “Okay, that’ll be a group Finesse Roll.”\nQUINN: “Lavelle, you lead?”\nNolan agrees, so Quinn, Miles, and Aliyah make Finesse\nReaction Rolls for their characters. Miles and Quinn\nsucceed, and Aliyah fails.\nSTELLA: “Miles and Quinn, you each add a +1 to the group roll,\nand Aliyah adds a −1 for that failure, which means you’re at a\n+1, Nolan. Let’s see how you do in leading the group.”\nNOLAN: “I’m going to spend a Hope to Utilize an Experience,\nthis is definitely the kind of intrusion Lavelle has done as a\n‘Treasure Hunter.’”\nNolan rolls a 2 on the Hope Die and a 4 on the Fear Die—\nthat’s 6. He adds +3 for his Finesse, +2 for the “Treasure\nHunter” Experience, and +1 from the party’s contribution\n(6+3+2+1=12).\n“That’s a total of 12, with Fear.”\nStella grimaces as she takes a Fear token.\nSTELLA: “A 12 is not going to do it. You make your way through\nthe outer courtyard of the fortress passing rusted swords,\ndecayed wooden emplacements, and rubble from the collapsing\nstone structure. You take a turn into the inner courtyard, with the\nkeep just ahead of you, when you hear rattling and the sounds of\nsteel on stone. All around you, skeletons lying in the snow begin\nassembling, stacking themselves up into moving figures wielding\nrusted swords and bows that shouldn’t work, but do. Since you\nrolled a failure with Fear, this opening move is going to be a big\none.”\nStella spends a Fear to make a group attack using the\nSkeleton Dredges.\n“All four of the smaller skeletons surround Lavelle, hacking\nand stabbing with their rusted blades.”\nStella makes one attack for the group of skeletons according\nto the text of the group attack action. She rolls a d20,\nadding 1 token for the Skeleton Dredges’ attack modifier of\n−1. The die comes up a 15, −1 for 14.\n“Lavelle, what is your Evasion?”\nNOLAN: “It’s 13.”\nSTELLA: “Then that’s a hit. You take 4 physical damage.”\nNOLAN: “That would be Minor damage, so I’m marking an\nArmor Slot to bring it down to nothing.”\nNolan has an Armor Score of 3 from his gambeson armor,\nso he has 2 more uses of armor available.\nSTELLA: “Now for the archers.”\nStella spends another two Fear to spotlight two additional\nadversaries.\n“They’re going to attack Shepherd and Rune.”\nThe archers are not using a group attack, so Stella rolls\n1d20+2 twice (once for each Skeleton Archer). She rolls a\n3 and an 8, for a total of 5 against Rune and 10 against\nShepherd. The attack against Rune misses (5 is lower than\nhis Evasion of 12), but the attack against Shepherd hits\n(they have an Evasion of 10, and if an attack total is equal\nto the target’s Evasion, the attack hits).\nStella rolls 1d8+1 for the archer’s damage. It’s a total of\n6—but that gets doubled thanks to the Skeleton Archers’\n“Opportunist” feature, which says, “When two or more\nadversaries are within Very Close range of a target, all\ndamage the archer deals to that target is doubled.” Since\nthe Skeleton Dredges mobbed the group, the archers are\nable to fire in moments when the heroes are more open.\n“That’s 12 physical damage for Shepherd.”\nStella turns to Quinn to see what they want to do about the\ndamage taken by Shepherd.\nQUINN: “12 is Major damage, so I’ll mark armor and only take\nMinor damage.”\nQuinn marks an Armor Slot on their sheet. But since a\ncharacter can only mark armor once per attack, they can’t\ncompletely negate the attack, and must mark a Hit Point for\nMinor damage. Shepherd's Armor Score is 4, so they have\nthree more uses of armor before it needs repairs.\nStella spends another Fear to spotlight the Skeleton Knight.\nSTELLA: “Once the other skeletons have engaged and the\narchers have loosed their arrows, the Skeleton Knight stomps\nforward and takes a big swing at Tabby.”\nThe Skeleton Knight has a +2 modifier, so Stella adds 2\ntokens to the d20. She rolls a 14 and adds +2 for a total of\n16.\n“I’m pretty sure a 16 hits Tabby?”\nALIYAH: “It does, alas.”\nStella rolls 1d10+2 for damage, getting a total of 10.\n135\tChapter 2: Full Example of Play\n\n-- 136 of 415 --\n\nSTELLA: “That’s 10 physical damage against Tabby as the\nknight comes in with an overhead blow. Their ‘Terrifying’ feature\ncauses Tabby and everyone within Close range of her to lose a\nHope, plus I will take a Fear.”\nALIYAH: “That's all of us.”\nAll four characters lose a Hope and Stella takes a Fear. The\ntotal of 10 would be Major damage, so Aliyah marks an\nArmor Slot to reduce it to Minor, then marks a Hit Point.\nEvery adversary has activated during this turn, and Stella\nwants to hold on to some Fear for later, so she returns the\nspotlight to the PCs.\nSTELLA: “The skeletons rushed you all at once like it was a\npracticed maneuver. I wonder how many other groups they’ve\nambushed like this. What do you want to do?”\nMILES: “This is going to be their last ambush. Magical flame\nignites in my hands, and I hurl it at the skeletons I’m in melee\nwith. I’m going to use ‘Wild Flame,’ targeting two of the little\nones and the big one with the sword.”\nSTELLA: “Cool, roll spellcast as your attack roll.”\nMILES: “This is exactly what my War College Prodigy\nExperience prepared me for.”\nMiles spends a Hope to add 2 tokens from his Experience\nto his +3 bonus from his Knowledge. He rolls 9 on the Hope\nDie, 11 on the Fear Die, then adds +5 from his modifiers.\n“That’s a 25 with Fear.”\nStella gains a Fear.\nSTELLA: “So you’ll get your bonus damage from School of War,\nand each of them has to mark a Stress because of Wild Flame.\nLet’s see that damage roll!”\nMiles rolls 2d6 for the “Wild Flame” spell, plus an extra\nd10 for his foundation subclass feature. He gets a total of\n17 magic damage, which is compared to each of the three\ntargets’ damage thresholds. Since the dredges have the\n“Minion (4)” feature, every 4 damage dealt to them kills an\nadditional dredge in range. The 17 damage is enough to kill\nall four minions in one blow.\nSTELLA: “Nice. With one graceful sweep of your hands, you hit\nthe first two you were aiming for, who collapse as you continue\nto erupt fire. Since they were minions, 17 damage was enough\nto kill all four of them. You turn them to ash.”\nNext, Stella looks at the knight’s thresholds. A 17 is above\nthe Severe threshold.\n“You turn your fire on the Skeleton Knight. Their armor\nbegins to melt and sag, melding to the bone. The knight’s\nstill coming, but you dealt them a Severe blow.”\nStella marks 3 HP for the knight.\n“Since you rolled with Fear, I’m going to spotlight the\nSkeleton Knight. As the minions collapse, the knight roars\nwith an unearthly voice, eyes glowing yellow with malice.\nThey raise the greatsword and hack into the group with\nhuge sweeping blows. I’m marking a Stress to attack all\nenemies within Very Close range. So all four of you.”\nStella rolls 1d20+2 for the attack, getting 6+2 for a total\nof 8. That total is compared to each character’s Evasion.\nLuckily, every PC’s evasion is above 8 and the attack misses\nentirely.\nStella spends a Fear to spotlight one of the archers, who\nattacks Shepherd. But this time Stella rolls a 4, for a total of\n6, which is below Shepherd’s Evasion.\nAfter that attack, Stella decides to save her Fear, since this\nencounter is just a warmup.\nSTELLA: “The knight is rampaging while the archers pelt you\nwith arrows. What do you do?”\nALIYAH: “I’d love to take a swing at them.”\nThe others nod.\n“I’m going to mark Stress to use ‘Reckless’ and get\nadvantage on an attack against the big boy. And I’ll spend\na Hope to Utilize my Pit Fighter Experience for +2.”\nAliyah rolls 5 on the Hope Die, 5 on the Fear Die, and 3\non the advantage die, +3 for Agility since Tabby’s using a\nbroadsword, +1 from the broadsword’s “Reliable” feature,\nand +2 for her Experience.\n“My total is 19, but since the dice matched, it’s a critical\nsuccess!”\nSTELLA: “Amazing! Give me that critical damage roll!”\nALIYAH: “I just got my second point of Proficiency, and the\nbroadsword has d8 damage dice. So that’s 16 plus a normal roll\nof 2d8, and +2 for my level thanks to ‘Combat Training.’”\nAliyah rolls a 1 and a 4, but rerolls the 1 thanks to her Blade\ndomain ability Not Good Enough, getting an 8. She adds\n8+4+2 (because of her “Combat Training” feature) for a\ntotal of 14, and then she adds that to 16 because of the\ncritical hit. An amazing 30 damage!\nThat’s a Severe hit for the Skeleton Knight, who only had 2\nHP left.\nSTELLA (looks up and asks): “So Aliyah, how do you want to\ndo this?”\nThe table bursts into cheers.\n136 \tChapter 2: Full Example of Play\n\n-- 137 of 415 --\n\nALIYAH: “The knight has a greatsword, right? I get right up\nin their face so they can’t bring the sword to bear. Then I hack\nthem apart like I’m chopping wood. There goes the tibia; there\ngoes the humerus. Then, I bring my sword around and do a\nbackflip, chopping off the knight’s head. I land with my shield\nbracing me as the knight topples into a shattering pile of bones.”\nSTELLA: “Amazing. Make sure to clear a Stress and gain a Hope\nfrom your crit. And as the skeleton collapses, they have one final\nreaction that triggers when they’re killed—they lash out with the\nlast of their strength to try to bring you with them, clawing at\nyou with a great skeletal hand.”\nStella rolls 1d20+2 and gets a 16+2 for 18. She rolls 1d4+8\ndamage and gets a 4 for a total of 12. Because the knight’s\n“Dig Two Graves” feature also forces the PC to lose 1d4\nHope, she rolls a d4, for a result of 2.\nBecause Tabby critically succeeded, Stella chooses to omit\nthe “Terrifying” feature from this attack.\n“The Skeleton Knight deals 12 physical damage back, and\nsteals 2 Hope from you as unlife fades from their bones.”\nALIYAH: “Oof. That’s Major damage, but I still have armor to\nspend, so I’m going to mark that and just take Minor damage.”\nAliyah marks an Armor Slot and marks a Hit Point for Minor\ndamage. She also loses 2 Hope from the “Dig Two Graves”\naction.\nSTELLA: “As you all look up from the destroyed knight, you see\nthat the archers have collapsed back into piles of bones. Rune,\nyou remember lore about groups of skeletons where the spell\nused to animate them is focused on one of the group, usually the\nstrongest.”\nMILES: “So next time, we go straight for the big one.”\nWith the combat complete, Stella takes a breath and resets\nthe scene.\nSTELLA: “You’re alone in the inner courtyard, the destroyed\nremains of skeletons around you. What do you do?”\nQUINN:“‘I’m guessing that’s not the last surprise we’ll see\ntoday,’ Shepherd says. ‘In we go?’”\nNOLAN: “Yes, but this time I want to be scanning for threats.”\nIn some situations, Stella might rule that Lavelle could just\nhear adversaries coming, but she wants to emphasize the\ndanger and uncertainty of this ruin.\nSTELLA: “That’s an Instinct Roll.”\nMILES: “Rune can help by listening for more of those strange\nbuilding-waking-up sounds or anything else suspicious.”\nMiles spends a Hope, rolls a d6 advantage die, and gets a 3.\nNolan makes an Instinct Roll for Lavelle. He gets a 1 on the\nHope Die and a 5 on the Fear Die. Nolan adds his Duality\nDice together for a value of 6, +1 for his Instinct, and +3 for\nRune’s help, for a total of 10 with Fear.\nStella nods, thinking for a moment as she gains a Fear.\nSTELLA: “You enter the keep with caution, looking for traps\nand listening for threats. The base of the tower is littered with\nthe decayed remains of many different kinds of folk—galapa\nand katari, dwarves and infernis. But none of them stir. You go\nthrough a barracks and a kitchen, finding the stairwell that leads\nyou down into the musty basement.\n“There’s no light here, but you have torches. Here and\nthere are some traps somehow still intact, or perhaps\nrepaired. There are three somewhat-fresh corpses\nof adventurers that must have been the survivor’s\ncompanions. At this altitude, they’re pretty well preserved.\nTwo are impaled on a wall of spikes that jutted out from\none side. The third is wrapped in the embrace of another\nSkeleton Knight, but that one does not move.\n“But what you don’t see, dear adventurers, is the wraith\nemerging from the wall behind you, looming over Shepherd\nand Tabby as Lavelle and Rune take the lead. The wraith\ngrows wide, its midnight eyes devouring the light behind\nyou. The room grows cold as it reaches out toward you…\nand that’s where we’ll end for tonight.”\nThe table erupts into excited chatter as the players debrief\nfrom their session together.\n137\tChapter 2: Full Example of Play\n\n-- 138 of 415 --\n\nQUESTIONS TO\nCONSIDER FOR GMS\n• Aliyah’s roll with Hope to finish off the Skeleton Knight meant\nthat the PCs would have been able to act again before the\narchers. Those archers hadn’t taken any damage, but Stella\ndescribed them falling apart after the knight died. Do you feel\nlike that was a satisfying end to the combat, or would you\nhave had the archers keep fighting? The explanation Stella\noffered to Rune could be taken as precedent, so if Stella\nchooses to not end a fight early in the future when the party\ndestroys the most powerful skeleton, she’ll want to have\nan idea in mind why things are different the second time to\nmaintain the integrity of the story.\n• Stella allowed Rune to make two jumps using the “Arcane Door”\nspell rather than making him roll for each casting. When a\ncharacter is using an ability like that, do you want to call for a roll\nfor each use or let one roll represent chaining the ability a couple\nof times like Stella did?\n• Would you have chosen to use “Terrifying” when the Skeleton\nKnight hit Tabby with “Dig Two Graves?” You don’t always have to\nuse every one of an adversary’s features, and Stella skipped it to\nhonor Tabby’s critical success.\n• In the fight with the skeletons, would you have had them attack\nthe group in the order and fashion that Stella did? Choosing\nwhich adversaries to spotlight—and when—helps determine\nthe shape of the fight and its rhythm, the ups and downs. How\nelse could that fight have gone? Would you have waited to use\nthe archers until after the Skeleton Knight?\n• Rune destroyed all four skeleton minions in one good hit, which\nmeant the attack on the other skeletons was wasted. Would\nyou have allowed Rune to use that other “Wild Flame” attack\nto attack the Skeleton twice, or maybe to hit one of the archers\neven though they were out of range? Or does losing the extra\nattack seem like a fair price for the certainty of being able to\nremove the minions?\n• What would you have done if Shepherd had rolled a success\nwith Fear when using their “Nature’s Tongue” spell to talk to\nthe goat? What would have been an interesting consequence if\nShepherd failed that roll entirely? Would the goat have run off,\nor would you have introduced another complication during their\nascent? Is there some complication that Stella could have used\nto foreshadow the skeletons or the wraith? Or would it have been\nbetter to gain a Fear and let the players keep pressing forward\nwithout an immediate consequence?\nAs you consider your answers to these questions and make\nrulings during the game, you’ll develop your own GM style. That’s\nthe key point to take away from this: there is no right answer.\nIt all comes down to your group and what creates the best\nexperience for your table. Your GM style might even change over\ntime, and that’s okay, too. Next up is chapter 3, which will give\nyou the tools you need to run a great game for your players.\n138 \tChapter 2: Full Example of Play\n\n-- 139 of 415 --\n\n\n\n-- 140 of 415 --\n\nCHAPTER THREE\nRunning an \tadventure\nThis chapter is only required reading if you plan to be the game\nmaster for a session or campaign of Daggerheart. If you’re reading\nthe book to create and play a character, you’ve reached the end of\nwhat you need to know. If you’re a game master, read on!\nintroduction\nAs a game master, you are responsible for guiding the narrative and playing as the world\nthat exists around your PCs. You are the massive sandstorm that hinders their journey,\nthe innkeeper they befriend while seeking shelter, the mysterious stranger in the corner\nwho asks them for help, or anything else that comes up during a session. Being a GM can\nbe one of the most fun, exhilarating, and fulfilling experiences at the table—but it can\nalso be intimidating, especially when you’re learning a new system.\nParts of this chapter are much more conversational than the rest of the book. The\nprevious chapters were primarily focused on delivering the mechanics of the game; while\nwe’re going to cover mechanics in this chapter as well, we’re also going to talk about\ntopics that lend themselves much better to a conversation than hard-and-fast rules:\naspects of gameplay like story structure, improv, and world-building. Because, at the\nend of the day, the “big secret” about GMing is that you aren’t bound by a rigid ruleset\nlike the players—you get to make it all up. Whether you made it up the week before, the\nday before, or in the moment at the table, you’re always crafting an experience for your\nplayers through the decisions you make.\nThis chapter is dedicated to giving you the tools you need to run a game of Daggerheart:\nunderstanding the core mechanics; creating memorable encounters; planning exciting\nsessions; knowing how to select, create, and use GM moves; crafting a full campaign;\nrunning dynamic NPCs; and more.\nCore Guidance\nIn this section, you’ll find some core guidance on how to run Daggerheart:\n• GM Principles\n• GM Best Practices\n• Pitfalls To Avoid\nThese three sections provide a foundation to help you get the most out of this game.\nThe “GM Principles” are your guiding star—when in doubt, return to these principles.\nThe “GM Best Practices” provide examples for you to follow, while “Pitfalls to\nAvoid” shows you what to stay away from when GMing Daggerheart.\nAs you read, don’t forget “The Golden Rule” on page 7.\nWhether you are a first-time GM, a veteran behind the screen,\nor anything in between, we encourage you to embrace the\nparts of this chapter that resonate with you and modify\nportions that don’t.\n140 \tChapter 3: Running an Adventure\n\n-- 141 of 415 --\n\n\n\n-- 142 of 415 --\n\nGM PRINCIPLES\nDaggerheart stands on the shoulders of a decades-long\ntradition of fantasy adventure TTRPGs that traces back to\nthe beginning of the form as we know it. This game shares\nmany characteristics with its predecessors—an attention\nto dramatized combat, familiar fantasy ancestries and\narchetypes, common touchstones from popular culture\nand folklore, and more. In addition, as you can see in the\n“Touchstones” section in the Introduction, Daggerheart draws\ninspiration from a variety of TTRPGs and other media beyond\nthe fantasy adventure genre.\nDaggerheart prioritizes and provides the tools for telling a\ncertain kind of heroic fantasy story. The system is focused\non building collaborative, character-focused stories full of\nemotion, and it weaves the narrative through the entire\nexperience, including its combat. Battle comes alive when\nthe dramatic beats and rhythm highlight the conflicting\nmotivations of combatants, when the characters’ bonds\nimpact their decisions in the fight, and when there is a goal\nbeyond simply killing every combatant. Daggerheart truly\nshines when the battles against adversaries are a dramatic\nbeat in a larger, emotionally grounded story about the wants\nand needs of the characters.\nFollowing these GM principles will help the whole\ntable have the best possible experience playing\nthis game:\n→ Begin and end with the fiction.\n→ Collaborate at all times, especially during conflict.\n→ Fill the world with life, wonder, and danger.\n→ Ask questions and incorporate the answers.\n→ Make every roll important.\n→ Play to find out what happens.\n→ Hold on gently.\nBEGIN AND END WITH THE FICTION\n“The fiction” refers to the story being created as you play.\nUse the fiction to drive mechanics—for example, when to call\nfor rolls, which GM moves to use, what Difficulty a roll should\nbe, or whether it should have advantage or disadvantage.\nDaggerheart’s rules exist to facilitate collaborative\nstorytelling, so the flow of play should begin with narrative\nand lead to mechanics when needed. The GM then connects\nthe results of the mechanics back to the fiction so play can\ncontinue smoothly.\n142 \tChapter 3: Core Guidance\n\n-- 143 of 415 --\n\nCOLLABORATE AT ALL TIMES,\nESPECIALLY DURING CONFLICT\nWhen you’re the GM, the players are your collaborators\nand their characters are the protagonists of the campaign.\nYou’re all working together to tell an exciting, memorable\nstory where heroes face incredible odds and often win in the\nend. Antagonism between player and GM should exist only\nin the fiction of the game, through the actions of NPCs and\nopposition within the narrative.\nNeither the PCs nor the players are your “enemy.” They’re\nthe opponents of the adversaries you play, but you and the\nplayers are on the same side: the side invested in telling an\namazing story together. When representing antagonists and\nchallenges, your main job is to balance presenting credible\nthreats with maintaining the trust of the players so that the\ncollaborative process can succeed.\nPart of collaboration is being a fan of the players and a fan of\ntheir characters. Being a fan of the players means consciously\nincluding story elements and themes they’ve expressed\ninterest in. It also means giving them the benefit of the doubt\nwhen they forget something small—especially something\nthat their character wouldn’t forget. Being a fan of the PCs\nmeans that while you’ll make their life challenging, up to and\npotentially including death, you’re never rooting for them\nto lose—you’re working with the players to ensure that the\ncharacters’ story is exciting and the environment around them\nis behaving with internal consistency.\nFILL THE WORLD WITH LIFE, WONDER, AND\nDANGER\nDaggerheart is a game of action, adventure, and high fantasy.\nOne of your biggest jobs as the GM is to present a world\nworthy of heroic tales. When running a player-driven game,\nyou can take the characters’ details, backgrounds, connection\nquestions, and worldbuilding notes your players provided\nboth in and out of your session zero (see the upcoming\n“Session Zero and Safety Tools” section on page 169) and\nuse those as a palette to paint an exciting world. Fill it with\nvibrant adventures that showcase rich cultures, take the\nPCs to wondrous places, and introduce them to dangerous\ncreatures. Strive to ground all of this in a place that honors the\nmotivations and personhood of everyone, from preeminent\nhigh nobility and demigods to humble farmers and artisans.\nASK QUESTIONS AND INCORPORATE THE\nANSWERS\nIn Daggerheart, the GM doesn’t have to do all the heavy lifting\nin terms of worldbuilding; we encourage you to share narrative\nauthority with the players. Many players will be drawn more\nfully into the story when you empower them to add their own\ntouches and details to your shared world.\nWhen the party enters a character’s hometown, you might\ninvite that player to describe the local market. Rather than\nnarrating a character’s deadly blow on a critical success,\nyou can ask the player to take the spotlight and detail their\ntriumph. In dramatic or even commonplace moments,\nyou might ask questions about a character’s motivations,\nemotions, and history, then connect the answers to the\ncurrent moment.\nSome groups may want to go even further, closing the gap in\nnarrative authority between players and GM by letting players\ntake authorship over entire regions or nations. Your players’\ninvolvement shows their interest in the story—do your best\nto respect their investment and fold their contributions into\nthe tale. As the GM, it’s your job to maintain the integrity of\nthe world and make adjustments when needed, but ensuring\nthat the players’ ideas are included results in a narrative that\nsupports the whole group’s creativity.\nMAKE EVERY ROLL IMPORTANT\nAction rolls in Daggerheart describe and resolve a moment\nwithin a story; these moments might be as short as a split-\nsecond dodge, as long as a full exchange of blows in combat,\nor an entire montage of chasing leads over the course of an\nevening.\nBecause the GM can choose to make a move in response to\na player’s failed roll or a result with Fear, and since every roll\ngenerates Hope or Fear, only ask the players to roll during\nmeaningful moments to ensure that every roll contributes\nto the story. Daggerheart is designed for cinematic play—\nwhen you provide information freely and allow characters to\nsucceed at tasks in line with their skills, the moments where\ncharacters do roll carry more risk and weight. Failures should\ncreate heartbreaking complications or unexpected challenges,\nwhile successes should feel like soaring triumphs!\nPLAY TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS\nDaggerheart thrives when the focus is on the emotional\njourney of the PCs and the GM leaves room for their impact.\nYou’re not playing a pre-planned story—the overarching plot\nof your campaign will emerge when you collaborate with the\nplayers to weave together the characters’ stories, the world,\nand major events.\nActively create room to be surprised by what the characters\nwill do, the choices they’ll make, and the people they’ll\nbecome. Try to prepare situations without expectations about\nthe solutions the players will find or create. While preparing\nadversaries and appropriate maps can help make for exciting\nscenes, always know you can adjust or completely throw out\nplans to follow inspiration when it strikes at the table.\nHOLD ON GENTLY\nImprovisational storytelling isn’t always perfect, and that’s\nokay. Hold on gently to the fiction, enough so that you\ndon’t lose the pieces that matter, but not so tightly that the\nnarrative has no room to breathe. Let yourself make mistakes\nand make changes. Smooth the edges and shape them to fit\nthe story. You’ll be the final arbiter and editor, but don’t worry\nif you need to go back and revisit or retroactively change\nsomething that came before.\n143\tChapter 3: Core Guidance\n\n-- 144 of 415 --\n\nGM BEST PRACTICES\nThe GM Principles give you guidance on what to do;\nmeanwhile, the GM Best Practices in this section help you\nknow how to do it. Think of the principles as the guiding stars\nfor your game’s ship, and the practices are the sails, ropes,\nand oars the ship uses to traverse that route.\n→ Cultivate a curious table.\n→ Gain your players’ trust.\n→ Keep the story moving forward.\n→ Cut to the action.\n→ Help the players use the game.\n→ Create a meta conversation.\n→ Tell them what they would know.\n→ Ground the world in motive.\n→ Bring the game’s mechanics to life.\n→ Reframe rather than reject.\n→ Work in moments and montages.\nCULTIVATE A CURIOUS TABLE\nTantalize players with a suspicious line muttered under an\nNPC’s breath, illustrate the signs of a lingering magical threat\nshimmering among the trees, hint at future danger looming\nover the distant horizon. Throw out hooks and see what\ncatches their interest. Foster an environment of creative\ninquiry at the table and allow that curiosity to lead you to\nincredible places.\nGAIN YOUR PLAYERS’ TRUST\nTrust is essential for a successful game of Daggerheart. The\nGM trusts the players to represent their characters' actions\nthoughtfully while keeping the table’s shared goals in mind.\nThe players trust the GM is acting in good faith—that when\nyou’re introducing challenges and doling out consequences,\nyou’re doing so with their interests in mind.\nMake promises and then follow through on them. Maybe an\ninnkeeper tells you they heard strange sounds coming from\nthe basement at night. When the PCs go to the basement\nthat evening, give them something interesting to find. Let\nplayers’ hunches come to fruition when you can—let them\nfeel like their understanding of the world is correct even if it’s\nincomplete. Perhaps the dangerous person they’re tracking\ndid come through the shop they just visited, or the ancient\nbook they’re seeking can be found in the library from a PC’s\nbackstory the party is now headed toward. When resolving an\naction, deliver on the expectations you set when you called for\nthe roll. If you tell the PC that a successful Agility Roll will let\nthem jump from their airship to another, when they succeed,\nlet them do it.\nThis also means admitting when you misstep or misspeak, and\nchecking in with your players when you’re unsure what they\nintend. If you didn’t realize a player was expecting to bypass\nthe entire patrol of guards with a single roll, you might back\nthe scene up and reestablish the stakes. Alternatively, you\nmight just let them know you’ll be more clear next time and\nallow them to sneak by the patrol this time.\nKEEP THE STORY MOVING FORWARD\nEvery time a player makes an action roll, the story should\nmove forward, success or failure. On a failure, the GM says\nhow the world responds and keeps the story moving. This\nis often referred to as “failing forward.” A character might\nnot get what they want if the roll goes poorly, but the story\nadvances through escalation, new information, or some other\nchange in circumstances.\nCUT TO THE ACTION\nHeroic fantasy stories consist of dramatic scenes, travel\nmontages, and downtempo moments around a campfire as\nthe heroes decompress and prepare for what’s ahead. If the\ntravel between two places won’t result in danger or interesting\nchallenges and everyone is excited to press forward, you can\ncut ahead to the action by saying something like, “So you\ntravel to Oldhome. Instead of playing this out and doing long\nrests, just clear all your marked Hit Points, Stress, and Armor\nSlots. We pick up on the edge of town after two long days\non the road. It’s only twilight, but you haven’t seen anyone in\nany of the outlying farms. There’s no sound coming from the\ntavern just ahead on your right. What do you do?”\nWhen a scene feels like it’s dragging or going in circles, you\ncan cut to a new scene to keep the narrative moving, letting\nthe players know they can flash back to the details of the plan\nor get their story straight later.\nNote that action doesn’t always mean combat. Action can be\ntense political drama as the party tries to maintain an alliance\nhanging by a thread. It can be navigating an archmage’s\nwarded and trapped hedge maze. It can be an emotional scene\nbetween a character and an NPC from their past. “Action”\nmeans any time there is tension and uncertainty—situations\nthat challenge the characters.\nIf the PCs have an enemy on the ropes and the players’\ninterest seems to be wavering, go ahead and have the foe\nrun off or surrender. Alternatively, just ask the players how\nthey finish out the fight. You should do your best to not let a\nscene become a slog where everyone feels obligated to see\nit through, even when no one is having fun. Part of being the\nGM is knowing which moments to focus on and which to push\noff-screen.\nHELP THE PLAYERS USE THE GAME\nIf you’re the GM, there’s a good chance that you’re the person\nwho has spent the most time learning Daggerheart’s rules.\nThus, you are best equipped to help your table understand\nhow to play. Help players reach the point where they see\nthe rules as a toolkit used to tell the story together, not as\nan obstacle that stands between them and enjoying the\nexperience of play.\nThe GM plays the opposition to the characters, but they’re\nworking with the players to tell the story. If the players are\nmissing something obvious or seem to be forgetting an\nability, don’t be afraid to guide them to it. The better an\nunderstanding the players have of the rules and mechanics,\nthe better they’re equipped to face increasingly difficult\nsituations and find clever ways to solve problems.\n144 \tChapter 3: Core Guidance\n\n-- 145 of 415 --\n\nCREATE A META CONVERSATION\nAs the GM, you should ensure players always feel comfortable\nshifting out of character to discuss something. Whether as\ncreative collaborators or friends enjoying a game together,\nplayers should feel empowered to utilize safety tools during\nthe game or ask for clarifications concerning the story or rules.\nTELL THEM WHAT THEY WOULD KNOW\nWhile the characters live in the fictional world and can utilize\nall their senses to experience it, the players only know what\nis established by your descriptions. Help the players by\nsharing details about their environment, giving them critical\ninformation, and offering facts their characters would easily\nknow or have already discovered. For example, three players\nwill all imagine “a wizard’s tower” differently, so include the\nspecific details that will shape their understanding of this\nparticular wizard’s tower. In many cases, if you don’t describe\nsomething, it doesn’t exist in the minds of the other people at\nyour table.\nIf there is information in a scene that characters would be able\nto perceive just by being in the space, don’t gate those details\nbehind a roll. For instance, if a PC asks about a desk or chest\nwithin the tower that the wizard might use to store important\nnotes, you can explain that the desk is clean and has no\ndrawers, but there is a large bookshelf filled with scrolls and\nstacks of paper. This is a detail the character could easily see\nwithout effort—you don’t need to ask the player to roll.\nGROUND THE WORLD IN MOTIVE\nThe characters in Daggerheart are driven by their motivations.\nAn ambitious baroness wants to gain status and increase her\nsphere of influence, so she acts to extend her power. A large\nswamp serpent is motivated by hunger and safety, so they\nhunt outsiders, but they might not chase them beyond the\nmuddy water if they’re sated.\nEach adversary stat block suggests a couple general motives,\nbut when you’re depicting important NPCs, consider both\ntheir short-term and long-term goals. A renowned thief might\nbe most immediately driven by a desire to steal crown jewels\nfrom a caravan, but their ultimate goal is to avoid capture by\nthe king’s guard—when both of these motivations impact\ntheir decisions, this creates a multidimensional character.\nThe players might not always know a character’s true motives,\nbut if you keep motivation in mind, you can depict the world\nwith depth and consistency. When you hint at or reveal an\nNPC’s motives, the players can push and pull on the NPC’s\nhopes and fears to create dynamic bonds.\nAction without motivation can feel like choreography. When\na supposed ally betrays the party, your story will hit harder\nif the players understand their motivations, truly making the\nbetrayal both sudden and (in retrospect) inevitable.\nBRING THE GAME’S MECHANICS TO LIFE\nSet a good example of how fiction and mechanics work\ntogether to enhance the game experience. For example, when\nan incoming storm will bring disaster to the nearby port town,\nplace a countdown (see the upcoming “Countdowns” section\non page 162) on the table labeled “The storm ravages Port\nEmerald” to show that the threat is real.\nMechanics and storytelling accentuate each other in nearly\nevery aspect of the game. When a PC rolls a failure with\nFear, go hard with your description of the consequence to\nconvey the gravity of the fallout, demonstrating the difference\nbetween a failure with Hope and one with Fear. Embody the\nenemy’s fatigue and desperation as they mark their last Stress\nbut continue to goad the party on. If the heroes are ambushed\nby a large band of raiders, lay out your battlemat and set down\nfigures for all fourteen enemies to show how outnumbered the\nparty is. Whenever possible, let the mechanics of the game\ndrive the story you’re telling and let the fiction you’ve created\nreinforce the mechanics you’re using.\nREFRAME RATHER THAN REJECT\nIf a player’s suggestion or description is generally implausible\nor out of sync with what has been established in the game,\ntry to find a way to reframe the situation and work with\nthem rather than rejecting their idea outright. You might\nask the table what it would take to accomplish a seemingly\nimplausible task, or call out a more workable part of the\nsuggestion and encourage the player to build on that aspect.\nExample: “Well, you might not be able to fly up to the\nplatform using the Telekinesis spell in your grimoire, but\nthere are plenty of large rocks here you could move around\nif you wanted.”\nWORK IN MOMENTS AND MONTAGES\nWhen framing a scene or playing out a beat of the story,\nthink about moments and montages. If the stakes are high\nand you want to zoom in on the flash of blades or the coded\nlanguage of courtly flirtation, you’re working in moments.\nGive those powerful, climactic moments their due, lingering\non the emotion and giving players time to savor the scene.\nHowever, not every part of the story needs to be told in\nmoment-by-moment description or full scenes. In those cases,\nconsider using montage, a sequence of short descriptions or a\nsummary that establishes what happens without lingering on\nthe individual moments. Montage can be used for actions that\ntake place over minutes, hours, or days.\nExample: “You spend the evening working the crowds to\nfind leads on the Scorpion Society, but I don’t think we need\nto play it all out. Tell us a little about what that looks like\nand then make a Presence Roll.”\n145\tChapter 3: Core Guidance\n\n-- 146 of 415 --\n\nPITFALLS TO AVOID\nLike any game that relies on collaboration, your Daggerheart\ncampaign will be impacted by the tactics and behaviors of the\npeople at the table. Here are a few areas where hang-ups are\nmore likely to occur when running Daggerheart, and ways to\nhelp your games run more smoothly if you encounter them.\n→ Undermining the heroes\n→ Always telling the players what to roll\n→ Letting scenes drag\n→ Singular solutions\n→ Overplanning\n→ Hoarding Fear\nUNDERMINING THE HEROES\nEven at level 1, the heroes possess both talent and experience.\nThis is a heroic fantasy game, and so the characters are\nassumed to be skilled in the basics of adventuring.\nWhen a roll doesn’t go well, things go badly and the character\ndoesn’t get what they want. Rather than describing the PCs\nbeing incompetent, it’s often better to show how the failure\nwas impacted by their target’s prowess, environmental\nfactors, or unexpected surprises. An easy way to make this\nwork is to describe the cool or smart move the character was\nmaking, then say “But…” and narrate a surprise, complication,\nor escalation.\n“Your blade slices through the air with grace, aimed\nperfectly at the guard’s shoulder. But she reacts just fast\nenough to bring up the haft of her halberd to block your\nblow, then swings her weapon to try to pin you against the\nwall. She’s way faster than a random guard at an outpost\nlike this should be. What’s a soldier with her skill doing\nstuck all the way out here?”\nIf the group has decided on a more comical tone, this\nguidance might not apply, but the default for Daggerheart\nis to assume the PCs are competent adventurers and make\nthe story exciting by depicting capable heroes struggling with\nextraordinary challenges.\nALWAYS TELLING THE PLAYERS WHAT TO\nROLL\nDaggerheart’s collaborative approach encourages players\nto express their character’s personalities through creative\nproblem-solving. In some situations, there might really only be\none trait that’s appropriate to roll; for example, traversing a\nslippery bridge is almost always going to be an Agility Roll. But\nin many situations, you can give the players the freedom to\ndecide how they’re going to handle a challenge and what trait\nthey want to use to accomplish the roll.\nExample: Stella, the GM, says “The spellrider on the giant\nbat just broke the enchantment keeping your airship aloft.\nYou’re all going to need to give me a roll to deal with the\nimminent fall. What do you do?”\nAliyah says, “I’m going to jump off the ship, grab a hold of\nthe bat to climb up, and wrestle the spellrider out of the\nsaddle. Can I do that with Agility?”\nNolan says, “I want to make a Finesse Roll using my Pirate\nExperience to cut one of the smaller sails free and use it like\na parachute.”\nLETTING SCENES DRAG\nIdeally, scenes should be focused, carrying the momentum\nof the story forward. Each roll should progress the narrative\nand build or resolve tension. At the natural conclusion of a\nscene, when the table energy is flagging, or when the players\nor characters are talking in circles, consider shaking up\nthe scene or resolving it and cutting away to a new one to\nmaintain that momentum. In social situations, prompt them\nto action by making a relevant GM move to introduce a ticking\nclock, provide new information, foreshadow future danger,\nor something similar. In a combat that’s dragging, remember\nnot all conflicts need to end with the enemy’s death—change\nthings up or create a dramatic resolution, such as an escape, a\nnatural disaster, or an intervention by an authoritative power.\nSINGULAR SOLUTIONS\nIf the GM has exactly one idea in mind for how the PCs\ncan solve a given problem, it can become challenging if the\nplayers get excited about another answer. You might have\ngood reason for why the solution you have in mind is the best\noption, but if the players have a clever idea, it’s often smart\nto adjust in the moment and figure out how to make their\napproach work.\nPuzzles are a great example of a situation where a singular\nsolution can cause problems. Everyone’s minds work in\ndifferent ways, and a puzzle or riddle with only one “right”\nanswer can shut down interesting alternatives. If the players\nget bogged down or frustrated with a puzzle or scene,\nconsider finding a way to move things along or adjust the\nsituation to let the character’s actions advance the story.\nThis might involve showing your hand to give the players\nmore context or checking in to ask how they’re feeling\nabout a scene.\n146 \tChapter 3: Core Guidance\n\n-- 147 of 415 --\n\nOVERPLANNING\nDaggerheart is designed to be played with a great deal of\nimprovisation to allow the players a large amount of creative\nagency—the group builds and discovers the world together.\nThe game is also built to be player driven, where the PCs’\nbackgrounds and connections serve as the primary fuel for the\nplot. For these reasons, we recommend leaving space for the\nstory to breathe.\nThe game works better when more preparation time goes into\nsituations for the characters to explore rather than scripting\nentire scenes and a set progression of story beats. Every GM’s\nstyle is different, and you may find that you benefit with more\ntime spent on forms of preparation that allow you to utilize\nplayer agency and creativity.\nYour players will often surprise you with daring or risky actions\nyou could never anticipate. When these great ideas come\nup, read the energy of the table and see if they’re all excited\nabout this new direction, and what opposition or narrative\nresponses might feed their enthusiasm. It’s okay to tell your\nplayers: “That took me by surprise. How about a quick ten\nminute break while I think about how this exciting change will\nplay out?”\nHOARDING FEAR\nBecause you gain Fear any time a PC rolls with Fear, as well as\nduring downtime, you’ll often have a stockpile of Fear to draw\non when you need it. Do your best to spend that Fear when\nyou have the opportunity. Spending more Fear at the start of\na combat or during a big moment can generate a lot of tension\nand set the stakes. This helps give shape to the scene, where\nthe PCs are on the ropes, being reactive more than proactive\nas they fight to get their footing. Then, as they get their\nequilibrium, they become proactive, directly pursuing their\nobjectives. Once they’ve made some strides toward those\nobjectives, they may roll with Fear. This creates an opening for\nyou to make another Fear move to complicate the scene.\nThis back-and-forth creates a dynamic scene, keeping the\nPCs on their toes and ultimately making the result all the\nmore satisfying whether it’s a hard-earned victory or a\nheartbreaking defeat.\n147\tChapter 3: Core Guidance\n\n-- 148 of 415 --\n\nCore GM Mechanics\nIn this section, we’ll cover the core mechanics you will use when GMing Daggerheart.\nTHE GM’S DIE\nThe players use two d12 Duality Dice as their primary dice\nfor action resolution, but as the GM, you’ll use one d20. This\ncreates a less predictable outcome for your rolls, while the\nplayers will have more reliable results. You’re just as likely to\nroll abysmally high or low as you are to roll a middling number,\nwhereas rolling two d12s creates a more stable bell curve\nof results. When you succeed, it creates a new and exciting\nchallenge, and when you fail, it is a relief and a boon for the\nplayers. The swingy nature of the d20’s results helps facilitate\na variety of outcomes during a session.\nMAKING GM ROLLS\nWhen an adversary attacks a PC, you roll to determine the\noutcome. This follows a similar process to PC action rolls,\nexcept you use a d20 instead of two d12s:\nSTEP 1: CALCULATE THE ATTACK ROLL\nRoll your d20 and add the adversary’s attack bonus\n(along with any other dice, such as an additional d20 for\nadvantage).\nSTEP 2: DETERMINE IF THE ATTACK HITS\nIf the roll result meets or beats the target PC’s Evasion, the\nattack succeeds and hits the target. Otherwise, the attack\nfails and doesn’t hit.\nSTEP 3: ON A HIT, ROLL FOR DAMAGE\nOn a success, roll the appropriate damage dice to\ndetermine how much damage the attack deals.\nIf you ever want to increase the chances an adversary\nwill succeed or fail, you can increase or decrease their\nattack modifier.\nGM Critical Successes\nPCs aren’t the only characters who can roll a critical\nsuccess—their adversaries can too! Whenever you roll a\n20 on the d20, your roll automatically succeeds.\nIf you critically succeed on an attack roll, you also deal\nextra damage. Start with the highest possible value the\ndamage dice can roll, and then make a damage roll as\nusual, adding it to that value. For example, if the damage\ndice are 2d8+2 and you critically succeed on the roll, you\nwould automatically deal 16 damage. You then roll the\ndice and get a 5 and a 7. So you add 16+5+7 for 28, plus 2\nfor the modifier, for a total of 30 damage.\nA critical success on a reaction roll does not have any\nadded benefit for an adversary.\nCALLING FOR ACTION ROLLS\nAfter a player describes a move they want to make during\nthe game, you might decide an action roll is necessary to\ndetermine how the scene progresses. Use this guide to\ndetermine what to present the player, choosing whichever\noption best fits the situation:\n• Let the PC guarantee success in exchange for a\nconsequence. If there is an opportunity for an interesting\nconsequence, offer the player that outcome in exchange\nfor performing the move without a roll; should they agree,\nthe PC succeeds and you narrate the repercussions. For\nexample, rather than rolling to see if a PC can jump from\none roof to another, you might allow them to automatically\nsucceed in exchange for being noticed by bystanders on\nthe street beneath them.\n• Establish the stakes. If a move is particularly difficult\nor dangerous and offers interesting consequences for\nsuccess or failure, establish the stakes for the roll so\nthat the player knows what to expect. Once everyone is\naligned, ask the player to roll and shape the fiction around\nthe results. For example, you can inform a player whose\nwants their PC to leap across rooftops that they’ll jump\nwithout alerting anyone on a success, but a failure will\nmean they crash into the streets below, suffering heavy\ninjuries. This empowers the player to take informed risks\nand lean into the fiction.\n• Make clear any guaranteed consequences. If a move is\nparticularly difficult or dangerous, and if it will certainly\nhave repercussions regardless of whether the PC succeeds\nor not, tell the player about those repercussions before\nthe move occurs. If the player wishes to proceed with\nthe move, ask them to roll and narrate the consequences\nwithout compromising on your repercussions. For\nexample, you might tell a player who wants their PC to\njump from the roof of a burning building to safety that the\nroof will collapse in the attempt. Even if the roll succeeds\nspectacularly, narrate the building groaning and collapsing\nin on itself, preventing anyone after from performing the\nsame escape.\nEXPERIENCES IMPACT FICTION\nWhen determining whether or not a roll is necessary, always\nconsider a PC’s Experiences and narrative history. For\nexample, if a PC has the “Expert Climber” Experience and\nthey’re attempting to scale a wall with no danger around, you\nmight decide they don’t need to roll—they can just do it. If\nthe climb would be tricky due to weather, but you don’t want\nthe story to focus on what happens if they fail, you might offer\nthem the option of marking a Stress in exchange for climbing\nwithout a roll. A character’s history should lessen their need to\nroll things they’re experienced in—you should introduce rolls\nonly when circumstances fall outside of their Experience, such\nas the PC trying to climb while archers rain arrows down from\nparapets above.\n148 \tChapter 3: Core GM Mechanics\n\n-- 149 of 415 --\n\nMAKING MOVES\nJust like the players have moves they can make during the\ngame, you also have GM moves that change the story in\nresponse to their actions. Unlike the PCs, you aren’t bound\nby specific spells you can cast or certain effects you can\ndo—when you make GM moves, you are acting to shape and\nfacilitate the story, whatever that requires. When you begin a\nGM move, you are starting your GM turn. When you are done\nmaking your GM move (or moves) and play passes back to the\nPCs, your GM turn is over.\nAt its most simple, a GM move is anything you do that guides\nthe story. These moves can heighten the danger, often by\nintroducing conflict or increasing the Difficulty, or they can\noffer ease and support, often by revealing new information\nor relieving a burden. This ebb and flow of opposition and\ncooperation facilitates dynamic play and invites opportunities\nfor both GMs and players to surprise one another with\nexciting choices.\nIf moves are your chance to make things happen in the\nscene, what should you do? The upcoming sections provide\nsuggestions (and examples in the “Example GM Moves”\nsection), but these decisions are hard to make in a vacuum.\nThe best tool you have at your disposal is listening to your\nplayers as they add to the narrative, then weaving your moves\ninto theirs.\nWHEN TO MAKE A MOVE\nKnowing when to make moves (and what kind of moves to\nmake) is a significant part of learning to GM Daggerheart. The\nfrequency and severity of these moves depends on the type of\nstory you’re telling, the actions your players take, and the tone\nof the session you’re running, but the general rule of thumb\nis this: you can make a GM move whenever you want. That’s\nright! You’re the GM—your job is not to crush the PCs or\nalways act adversarially; it’s to help tell a story. You should be\nmaking moves whenever you see an opportunity to do so.\nConsider making a GM move when a player does one of the\nfollowing things:\n• Rolls with Fear on an action roll.\n• Fails an action roll.\n• Does something that would have consequences.\n• Gives you a golden opportunity.\n• Looks to you for what happens next.\nNote that making a big move isn’t always necessary! When\nyou can’t see an opening for a narratively impactful move,\nremember the other tools in your toolkit: make a PC mark\na Stress, progress an event happening outside the current\nscene, or even defer the consequence for later. For example,\nperhaps nothing happens when you break the cursed object\nnow, but its rightful owner might come to collect their due\ndown the line.\nThey Roll with Fear on an Action Roll\nIf a PC rolls with Fear, play returns to you to make a GM move.\nWhether their roll failed or succeeded, your move should\ngenerally build on the action the player just attempted.\nThey Fail an Action Roll\nIf a PC fails an action roll, play returns to you to describe the\nfailure and what comes next in the story because of it. If it’s a\nfailure with Fear, consider choosing a harsher consequence or\ncomplication than you would otherwise.\nThey Do Something That Would Have\nConsequences\nSometimes a PC makes a move that, regardless of whether\nthey succeed or fail, has inevitable consequences. In these\nsituations, you can make a move to reflect that outcome.\nFor example, if a PC wants to save someone from a burning\nbuilding, the player declares they want to run inside. You\ncan explain to that player that no matter how high they roll,\na consequence will occur: the character takes damage from\nthe fire, the building collapses around them to prevent an\neasy escape, or something they’re carrying is damaged in the\nflames.\nThey Give You a Golden Opportunity\nSometimes, a PC’s decision gives you the perfect opportunity\nfor a dramatic move—perhaps they move too close to\na waiting predator or get distracted while watching for\nintruders. In these cases, a roll doesn’t prompt your move,\nbut you can still seize the opportunity for a powerful dramatic\nbeat. For example, if the PCs are hiding from a group of\nthieves while discussing the bandit leader’s plans, a PC might\nsay with dramatic irony, “But surely they won’t look in the\neaves of every barn in the district!” In response, you might\ndescribe the barn door noisily swinging open as a bandit steps\ninside, a lit torch in one hand and a sword in the other as they\npeer into the rafters where the characters are hiding.\nThey Look to You for What Happens Next\nYour job is to keep the story moving, so when the players\naren’t sure what to do, they’ll likely look to you to find out. This\nis usually a sign that you should make a move. For example, if\nthe PCs are conversing with each other during a dinner party\nthen reach a lull in the conversation, the players might glance\nat you to see if it’s time for an NPC to speak or take action.\nSimilarly, you should make a move when the players are\nstumped about what to do or when they seem frustrated\nabout a lack of information. When you need to get the scene\nmoving again, a softer move might do the trick (see the\nupcoming “Softer and Harder Moves” section), but sometimes\na harder move is needed to provoke the PCs to action.\n149\tChapter 3: Core GM Mechanics\n\n-- 150 of 415 --\n\nHOW TO CHOOSE A MOVE\nWhen a player makes an action roll, the result influences\nhow the scene changes—but those changes depend on your\nchosen GM move. Consider the following examples of phrases\nyou might say to the player after an action roll, and what\nmoves you might make:\nCritical Success\n“That’s a critical success! You get what you want and a\nlittle extra. Gain a Hope and clear a Stress. Tell me how this\nhappens…”\nLet the player describe their success, then give the party an\nadditional opportunity or advantage in the scene because of it.\nSuccess with Hope\n“That’s a success with Hope, so you get what you want. Gain a\nHope. Tell me how this happens…”\nLet the player describe their success, then show how the\nworld reacts to it.\nSuccess with Fear\n“That’s a success with Fear, so you get what you want, but it\ncomes at a cost. I gain a Fear and here’s what happens…”\nWork together to describe the PC’s success, then introduce a\ncomplication or cost as a GM move—but don’t negate their\nsuccess with this consequence. Maybe an adversary attacks\nthem in response or they mark a Stress from the toll it took to\nsucceed. Perhaps they realize their ally is in imminent danger\nor get new information that raises the stakes.\nFailure with Hope\n“That’s a failure with Hope, so things don’t go according to\nplan, but you gain a Hope. Here’s what happens…”\nDescribe how the PC fails to get what they want, and how\nthe situation goes wrong as a result, by introducing a minor\ncomplication or consequence as a GM move. Maybe they spot\na new danger they must now contend with, face an attack or\nmark a Stress from an enemy they’re engaged with, or face\ncollateral damage that puts them in a more difficult position.\nFailure with Fear\n“That’s a failure with Fear, so it doesn’t go well! I gain a Fear\nand here’s what happens…”\nDescribe how things go wrong by introducing a major\ncomplication or consequence as a GM move. Maybe they\nreceive bad news and the information puts them in immediate\ndanger, they become the focus of multiple adversaries, they\nare separated from their party, or an important opportunity is\nlost for good.\nQUICK REFERENCE: RESOLVING ACTION ROLLS\nIf you’re unsure how to resolve a roll, think about these\nquick phrases:\nSuccess with Hope: Yes, and… (You get what you want\nand gain a Hope.)\nSuccess with Fear: Yes, but… (You get what you want,\nbut there’s a consequence, and the GM gains a Fear.)\nFailure with Hope: No, but… (Things don’t go as planned,\nbut you gain a Hope.)\nFailure with Fear: No, and… (Things don’t go as planned\nand it gets worse. The GM gains a Fear.)\nObvious Moves\nSometimes, you’ll know without hesitation how to make a\nmove in a scene. A PC just rolled a success with Fear on a\nmelee attack against a powerful adversary? They get what\nthey want, but it comes at a cost. In response, your move\nmight have the adversary strike back or throw the PC across\nthe battlefield. Maybe you’ve set up the scene so that they’re\nfighting on a precarious ledge, and the attack from the PC was\nsuccessful, but momentum carries them dangerously close\nto the cliff’s edge and they must make an Agility Roll to see if\nthey can keep from falling off.\nOther times, the move might not be immediately obvious.\nIn that case, you can draw inspiration from the upcoming\n“Example GM Moves” section. If all else fails, either have the\nPC mark a Stress, or tell them “everything is fine… for now”\nand think about how you can bring more danger their way in a\nlater scenario.\nPlayer-Driven Moves\nIf you’re still not sure what to do, you might turn the decision\nover to the player, giving them an option of two different\nthings or simply asking them what happens next. They\nsometimes put themselves in a more interesting or\ndangerous situation than you ever would’ve!\nSocial Moves\nKeep in mind that GM moves are applicable in any situation.\nWhile combat mechanics naturally lend themselves to\nsignaling when enemies attack, how much damage they deal,\nand so on, the concept of “making moves” applies across all\nscenarios within Daggerheart. A tense dinner between rivals,\nan important negotiation, an emotional confrontation—all\nof these scenes have a back-and-forth between the PCs and\nthe GM. You can use moves to accomplish the single most\nimportant part of GMing: listening and responding to\nyour players.\n150 \tChapter 3: Core GM Mechanics\n\n-- 151 of 415 --\n\nAVOID UNDERMINING SUCCESS\nOn a success with Fear, one pitfall GMs can run into is\nundermining their players’ success when making a GM move\nas the consequence. For example, if a PC makes a Finesse roll\nin an attempt to move stealthily through a hallway, and they\nsucceed but roll with Fear, don’t use your move to sound an\nalarm bell or make someone bump into them, spoiling their\ncover. The PC succeeded on the roll, and that success should\nbe honored, even if it comes with a consequence. Instead,\nconsider options such as introducing a new obstacle at their\ntarget destination or adding a new enemy approaching from\nbehind to complicate their situation.\nSimilarly, if a PC does something cool—such as cleverly\ncasting a spell—let them enjoy it instead of immediately\nfoiling their schemes and let the scene play out for a while,\nusing moves to change and escalate the scenario rather than\nend the effect. For example, a PC might circumvent a trap\nyou laid; rather than immediately use a GM move to spring\nthe trap into working, let the PC feel smart as you instead\nuse your next GM move to summon more foes or telegraph\nwhat other dangers might be on the path ahead. Use your GM\nmoves to immediately shut down an effect when it involves a\nclimactic moment or a powerful adversary—when you need\nto show that the situation is dire.\nKeep this principle in mind as you make GM moves. The\nfollowing sections provide advice on what kind of moves\nyou can make and how to implement harder moves with\ncare. After all, not every move will be enjoyed in every\ncircumstance. If the PCs are delivering a powerful artifact to\na wizard to be destroyed, having a minor adversary steal the\nartifact can spark an exciting story arc—or it can throw icy\nwater on the party’s excitement and make them feel all their\nwork to retrieve it was pointless. As always, communication\nand collaboration are key, and hard actions shouldn’t negate\nplayer agency or feel punishing.\nSOFTER AND HARDER MOVES\nWhen play turns to you, you have many options for how to\nrespond. Some are soft moves that are generally easier on the\nplayers—they give the party new information about the scene\nand offer them an opportunity to react to it. Others are hard\nmoves that are usually harsher, bigger, or more direct—this\nfiction happens without allowing PCs to intercede. Consider\nusing softer moves on failures with Hope and harder moves on\nany roll with Fear. Additionally, you might start off a session\nusing softer moves and progress into harder moves as the\nstory comes to a climax. Remember that your moves set the\ntone for a challenge or threat.\nThe next section contains example moves in approximate\norder of severity.\n151\t151\tChapter 3: Core GM Mechanics\n\n-- 152 of 415 --\n\nEXAMPLE GM MOVES\nGM moves are your most important tool as a storyteller\nin Daggerheart.\nThe way you make moves truly defines your story and style.\nEveryone who plays this game will interact with GM moves\ndifferently, so you should never feel like you have to use them\nthe same way anyone else does! As long as you and your table\nare having fun, you’re staying true to the story, and you’re\nacting as a fan of your players, that’s what matters.\nThe following examples span the gradient from softer moves\nto harder moves. Look down the list until you find the move\nthat seems appropriate. Don’t describe your move in the\nterms used in this section. Instead of saying “I show the\ncollateral damage,” contextualize it for the players—describe\nhow their missed arrow pierces the frayed rope holding a\nlantern aloft, and now the room in the bandits’ hideaway has\nbeen set ablaze!\nWhen you make a GM move, you might try one of these:\n→ Show how the world reacts.\n→ Ask a question and build on the answer.\n→ Make an NPC act in accordance with their motive.\n→ Lean on the character’s goals to drive them to action.\n→ Signal an imminent off-screen threat.\n→ Reveal an unwelcome truth or unexpected danger.\n→ Force the group to split up.\n→ Make a PC mark Stress as a consequence for their\nactions.\n→ Make a move the characters don’t see.\n→ Show the collateral damage.\n→ Clear a temporary condition or effect.\n→ Shift the environment.\n→ Spotlight an adversary.\n→ Capture someone or something important.\n→ Use a PC’s backstory against them.\n→ Take away an opportunity permanently.\nSHOW HOW THE WORLD REACTS\nTo show how the world reacts, simply think about the way the\nPC’s move has affected the world and narrate that change in\na way that creates new opportunities for the PCs to act. At its\nsoftest, you might describe them successfully breaking down a\ndoor, then give them a description of the next room and what\ndanger they find there. You could also make the person they’re\nnegotiating with present an option for compromise, or have an\nenemy they just hit attempt to retreat. This is your opportunity\nto make the world around the PCs feel real and alive.\nASK A QUESTION AND BUILD ON THE\nANSWER\nThis is perhaps the most collaborative move—presenting the\nplayer with a question, and using their answer as truth to build\nthe scene. You might ask them something like, “What do you\nsee in this city that reminds you of home?” or “What about this\nplace tells you someone else was here before you?” Typically\nutilized when establishing information about a scene or when\nyou’re interested in a specific character or player’s perspective\non the current situation, this move can be a great way to get\nthe whole table involved in worldbuilding during the game.\nMAKE AN NPC ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH\nTHEIR MOTIVE\nWhen a scene includes characters other than the PCs, you can\nspotlight what these NPCs are doing in response to the PCs’\nactions. You might show a friendly NPC helping the party in a\nfight, a group of townsfolk taking cover, or an enemy moving\npositions. Make sure their actions always flow from their\nmotive.\nLEAN ON THE CHARACTER’S GOALS TO\nDRIVE THEM TO ACTION\nOne of the most powerful ways to change a scene as a GM is\nto introduce something personal to the PCs. If the character\nis seeking out a specific object or creature, you might reveal\nwhere it is and why it’s going to be so challenging to get there.\nUsing a PC’s desires to drive them forward is a great way to\nreinforce why this scene matters to them.\nSIGNAL AN IMMINENT OFF-SCREEN THREAT\nA rustle in the trees, an alarm bell being sounded, the clanging\narmor of reinforcements headed their way—this move creates\na ticking clock for your PCs. They need to get moving now.\nREVEAL AN UNWELCOME TRUTH OR\nUNEXPECTED DANGER\nThis versatile move is usually applicable in any scene—you’re\nsimply heightening the drama or tension. Maybe an unexpected\nperson steps out of the shadows, or the characters receive\nbad news that makes them rethink their plans. A soft version\nof this move might manifest as moving a group of dangerous\nfoes within striking range of the PCs or revealing a guard\ncaptain just when the PCs think they have the upper hand over\nthe guards. A harder version of this move might be an enemy\npinning a PC against the wall, making a PC Restrained until they\nmake a roll to escape the adversary’s grasp.\nFORCE THE GROUP TO SPLIT UP\nUsually the result of an environmental hazard or a trap,\nsplitting up the party can force your players to think differently\nthan they normally would about how to accomplish a task.\nThis move can also make for some fun cutting back and forth\nbetween scenes as the two groups work independently before\nfinding a way back to each other.\n152 \tChapter 3: Core GM Mechanics\n\n-- 153 of 415 --\n\nMAKE A PC MARK STRESS AS A CONSEQUENCE\nFOR THEIR ACTIONS\nThis move is perfect for a success with Fear when you’re not sure\nwhat other consequences apply—the PC can get it done, but it’s\nnot going to be easy. For example, the PC can charge across the\nbattlefield, but they’ll mark a Stress to do it. As a softer move, you\ncan also make this an offer instead—maybe you give them the\nchoice to only make it halfway across and not mark a Stress.\nWhen you have a player mark Stress, describe why the circumstance\nis stressful—or ask the player to do so. Is it physically taxing in some\nway? Does it bring up painful memories? Is the PC under significant\npressure?\nMAKE A MOVE THE CHARACTERS DON’T SEE\nThis move is most useful when you have something happening\nbehind the scenes that you’re waiting to reveal. You might start a\nnew countdown or tick down a current one, add more damage dice\nto an enemy’s upcoming damage roll, adjust a narrative situation\nthe PCs have yet to encounter, or create another consequence the\nplayers can’t foresee. When you do this, don’t tell them the move,\nbut do create fun tension at the table by letting them know your\nmachinations have changed: “Everything is fine… for now.”\nDepending on your style of play, you might instead tick down a\ncountdown timer the players can see but don’t fully understand.\nYou could also cut away to a scene that the players see but the\ncharacters don’t.\nSHOW THE COLLATERAL DAMAGE\nThis is a great move to use when the player tries to do something\npowerful and there’s a consequence. That fireball that missed?\nMaybe it went wide, struck the side of the mountain, and now they\nhear rumbling from above. An avalanche is about to swallow them!\nWhenever a PC does something that significantly impacts the world\naround them, you can use this move to show them the natural\nramifications of that event.\nCLEAR A TEMPORARY CONDITION OR EFFECT\nIf there is a temporary condition or effect on an adversary or\nenvironment, you can choose to clear it. When you make this move,\nlead with the narrative, describing who or what causes the effect\nto end, then how it changes the PCs’ situation. For example, if an\nadversary is Vulnerable because they’re being held down by a tangle\nof vines, you might describe them using their blade to hack away at\nthe vines to break free. Or if the effect is caused by a spell, you might\ndescribe the adversary unleashing a hail of arrows toward the caster,\nmissing them but inhibiting their ability to focus on the spell any\nlonger. If a PC just started an effect, think twice before ending it—it\nwill be more satisfying if they see it impact the scene first. Clearing\nsome conditions or effects might also require you to spend Fear.\nSHIFT THE ENVIRONMENT\nYou can change the environment the PCs are navigating to raise the\nstakes. If you’re using an environment stat block, you could choose\nto utilize one of its actions. Otherwise, affect the area surrounding\nthe PCs in a fun and engaging way—maybe the rope bridge they’re\ncrossing suddenly snaps or a river sweeps them off their feet.\nPerhaps an angry crowd packs the marketplace, obscuring the\nperson they’re following, or a building falls toward the PCs after\nbeing struck with a spell that missed its target.\nSPOTLIGHT AN ADVERSARY\nHeroes are molded when pitted against adversaries of equal\nmettle—this move allows your adversaries to act meaningfully in a\nscene. When you make this move, an adversary can move anywhere\nwithin Close range and perform an action. In battle, this often\nmanifests as an attack—they move into Melee range with a PC,\nmake an attack roll, and showcase their power whether the attack\nsucceeds or fails. But this move isn’t limited to violence. When you\nspotlight an adversary, they can demonstrate their tactics, reveal\ntheir motives, use one of their actions, or change the scene in an\ninteresting way. Whether an adversary bludgeons a PC with jagged\nmaul, floods the room with choking gas, or reveals that a local leader\nis in their pocket, this move is your chance to prove their prowess.\nSometimes, you might want to spotlight more than one adversary\nduring your GM turn. You can spend a Fear to make an additional\nGM move, shifting the spotlight to another adversary in the scene.\nYou can spend any amount of Fear you currently have to move the\nspotlight around the battlefield, but you can’t typically spotlight the\nsame adversary more than once during your turn.\nCAPTURE SOMEONE OR SOMETHING IMPORTANT\nTaking away something the party desperately wants or needs can\nquickly ratchet up the tension in a scene. You might knock a weapon\nfrom a PC’s hand, capture a fellow party member or an ally of the\ngroup, or steal a powerful object from right under their noses. This\nmove is an exciting, fiction-forward way to advance the story.\nUSE A PC’S BACKSTORY AGAINST THEM\nIntegrating a player’s backstory into your move can have a huge\nimpact on the PC and make the story much more personal to them.\nMaybe someone from their past shows up, a mistake they made long\nago catches up with them, or the scene parallels a past experience,\ngiving them the chance to make a different choice. Grounding the\nmove in a character’s history ensures their next decisions matter all\nthe more to them.\nTAKE AWAY AN OPPORTUNITY PERMANENTLY\nWhen things are dire, sometimes the PCs lose an opportunity they\nonce had. A softer version of this move might be to collapse the\nparty’s straightforward pathway through a cave system, forcing them\nto find another, more treacherous way to escape. A harder version\nof this move would be to kill a valuable NPC or destroy a powerful\nobject the party desperately needs. These moves can be used to\ngreat effect when you want to twist the trajectory of the story in a\nnew direction.\n153\tChapter 3: Core GM Mechanics\n\n-- 154 of 415 --\n\nFEAR\nWhile PCs gain Hope as a metacurrency during the game, you gain Fear.\nGAINING FEAR\nWhen you start a campaign, you begin with an amount of Fear\nequal to the number of PCs. Whenever a PC rolls with Fear,\nyou gain a Fear. You can also gain Fear from the players taking\ndowntime, certain PC abilities or spells, and specific adversary\nfeatures.\nYou can hold up to a maximum of 12 Fear.\nTRACKING FEAR\nYou can track Fear with tokens, a die, or any other counting\nmethod, and you should keep this pool visible to players\nduring the game. Fear carries over between sessions, so note\nhow many Fear you have at the end of each session and begin\nthe next time with that same pool.\nSPENDING FEAR\nWhenever you spend Fear, describe how fate changes the\nworld against the characters. What interrupts or counters the\nPCs? How does an adversary prepare for a powerful attack?\nWhat barrages the PCs’ senses as the raging avalanche\nswallows them?\nWhen you spend a Fear, you can:\n→ Interrupt the players to make a move.\n→ Make an additional GM move.\n→ Use an adversary’s Fear Feature.\n→ Use an environment’s Fear Feature.\n→ Add an adversary’s Experience to a roll.\nTip: As with any GM move, spending Fear shouldn’t\nundermine the players’ fun. Fear is a tool for you to enhance\nthe scene, create dramatic tension, and raise the stakes, not\nto shut down a PC’s heroic actions.\nInterrupt the Players to Make a Move\nYou can spend a Fear to make a GM move as if the PCs had\nfailed an action or rolled with Fear, allowing you to interrupt\nbetween the players’ moves. This tactic is most useful when\nyou want to make a move during a slew of successes—for\nexample, if the PCs roll a success with Hope four times in a\nrow during combat and you want to give your adversaries a\nchance to fight back, you can spend a Fear to interrupt the\naction and spotlight an adversary.\nMake an Additional GM Move\nAfter making a GM move, you can spend a Fear to make an\nadditional move this GM turn. For example, when a player rolls\na failure or rolls with Fear, you might spotlight an adversary\nto show them stealing the party’s carriage and starting to ride\naway, then spend a Fear to have the archer in the tree shoot at\nthe PCs as cover fire for the carriage heist.\nUse an Adversary’s Fear Feature\nIn addition to each adversary’s standard features, some\nadversaries have powerful Fear Features. You can use an\nadversary’s Fear Features by spending the indicated number\nof Fear.\nYou can always improvise a Fear Feature for an adversary,\neven if they already have predetermined Fear Features.\nJust spend a Fear and come up with a big adversary move\nthat might otherwise feel overpowered or arbitrary (see the\nupcoming “Improvising Fear Moves” section).\nIf you’ve spent Fear to make an additional GM move to\nactivate an adversary, you must additionally spend the\nrequired amount to activate a Fear Feature. For example, once\nthe thief steals the party’s carriage and you’ve spent a Fear to\nhave the archer rain down a hail of arrows, you could spend\nan additional Fear to activate a third thief in the scene. If this\nthief has a Fear Feature you want to activate, you would spend\na fourth Fear to utilize it.\nUse an Environment’s Fear Feature\nEnvironments can have their own features that require\nspending Fear to activate. You can use an environment’s Fear\nFeature by spending the indicated number of Fear.\nEven if an environment has predetermined Fear Features, you\ncan also spend Fear to improvise a big environment move that\nmight otherwise feel overpowered or arbitrary.\nAdd an Adversary’s Experience to a Roll\nWhen making a roll for an adversary, if their Experience would\napply to the situation at hand, you can spend a Fear and add\nthe Experience’s modifier to the roll. When you do, showcase\nhow their Experience enhances the action to help ground this\nmechanic in the narrative.\n154 \tChapter 3: Core GM Mechanics\n\n-- 155 of 415 --\n\nHOW MUCH FEAR SHOULD I SPEND IN A SCENE?\nSpending Fear is one of the GM’s strongest tools for\ninflicting consequences and enhancing the stakes of a scene.\nEach scene plays a specific role in the story, and not all scenes\nneed the same level of drama and danger. The more important\na scene is to the story, the more likely a GM is to want to use\nFear to complicate the PCs’ lives and add to the danger of\nthe fiction.\nThe GM adjusts the stakes by increasing or decreasing the\namount of Fear they spend in a scene—more Fear to heighten\nthe tension, fewer Fear to ease off. You might surprise the PCs\nby spending Fear to add twists to a scene to keep the players\non their toes, turning what the PCs thought was an incidental\nor minor scene into one with major stakes. You might spend\na few Fear at the beginning of a scene to establish the danger\nof a story beat and force the PCs to dig deep and overcome it,\nthen either spend additional Fear as you gain it or store it for a\nfuture scene.\nHere is a rough guide of how much Fear you might want to spend in a given scene depending on its role in the story:\nScene Type \tExample Scenes \tAmount of Fear Spent\nIncidental \tA catch-up between PCs after an emotionally charged scene; gathering\ninformation; resupplying at a local market; resting during downtime.\n0–1 Fear\nMinor \tA travel sequence; a minor skirmish that introduces new foes or signals\nfuture trouble.\n1–3 Fear\nStandard \tA substantial battle with a notable objective; perilous travel that tests\nmight and wit; a tense social encounter seeking crucial information or\naid.\n2–4 Fear\nMajor \tA large battle with a Solo or Leader adversary; a character-defining\nscene with a significant change to a character’s personal story (such as\nrevelation, growth, and betrayal).\n4–8 Fear\nClimactic \tA major confrontation with the villain of a story arc; an epic set piece\nbattle; a judicial duel to determine an important NPC’s fate.\n6–12 Fear\nWhat Do I Do with All This Fear?\nIf you find yourself coming into a battle with a large amount of Fear (especially over 10), consider the following approaches:\nAct First\nSpend a Fear immediately to interrupt the PCs and spotlight\nan adversary to begin the fight.\nSpend Consistently\nEach time your turn comes around, make a GM move, then\nspend a Fear to make an additional move. If you gained Fear\nfrom a PC’s roll, consider spending that one as well, either on\nan additional GM move or a Fear Feature. Your pool of Fear\nwill slowly deplete, but this method will provide significant\npower every time play returns to you.\nCome Out Strong\nYou might choose to spend enough Fear to spotlight a majority\nof the adversaries during your first GM turn. This is a big move\nthat can put the PCs on the back foot at the beginning of the\nfight, giving them the opportunity to feel like they’re turning\nthe fight around.\nDraw Blood\nEvery time an adversary misses an attack, you might spend\na Fear to spotlight additional adversaries until one of them\nsuccessfully strikes a PC. This can help make your GM turn\nfeel dynamic even when your first attack misses.\n155\tChapter 3: Core GM Mechanics\n\n-- 156 of 415 --\n\nImprovising Fear Moves\nWhether you’re improvising adversaries and environments or\nusing existing ones, you might find a moment where you want\nto put your thumb on the scale to make something dramatic\nhappen or to escalate the scene. You can always improvise a\nGM move, but there might be situations where you want to\nmake an especially hard move. In those situations, you can\nmake a Fear move. By spending Fear when you declare the\nmove, you communicate and respect the scale of the action\nyou’re taking.\nA Fear move should redefine a scene, change the terms,\nraise the stakes, modify or move the location, or accomplish\nanother pivotal action.\nFear moves commonly include one or more of these elements:\n• Introducing new adversaries to a scene when their\nappearance hasn’t been foreshadowed or lacks context.\n• An adversary activating a powerful spell or transformation\nto deal massive damage or boost their capabilities.\n• An environment exerting a strong negative effect\non the party.\nFor additional guidance on creating Fear moves, reference the\nexisting Fear moves included in the “Adversary Features” and\n“Environment Features” sections and stat blocks of chapter 4.\nExamples of Improvised Fear Moves\nExample 1: The party has confronted a corrupt noble who\nthe GM, Stella, planned to use as a recurring villain, but most\nof the noble’s HP are already marked and the party is close to\ndispatching them before their plans can be revealed. Deciding\nthat they don’t want to change plans and let the PCs claim\nthis unexpected victory, Stella improvises a Fear move to\nallow the noble to escape using a method that makes sense\nfor the adversary but hasn’t been set up in the fiction yet. The\nnoble, not previously shown to use magic, produces a token\nthat allows them to teleport away. The GM has spent a Fear\non an improvised “Take away an opportunity” move, and the\nvillain survives to fight another day.\nExample 2: In a battle with the party, a Solo adversary’s\ndamage output isn’t proving as much of a threat as Stella\nwould have liked. She might decide to spend Fear and\nimprovise an adversary feature where the enemy flies into\na rage, increasing their damage for the remainder of the\nscene. Stella leads with the fiction, describing the enemy’s\nincreasing desperation due to their significant wounds, then\nsignals the mechanical escalation to the PCs—the enemy’s\ndamage output will be much higher from here on out.\nExample 3: During a scene where Quinn’s druid is tracking a\nkidnapper, Shepherd rolls a success with Fear. Stella invites\nQuinn to describe how their action allows the PCs to gain\nground, then spends a Fear and describes a huge shadow\npassing over the group as they spot the kidnapper on the\nhorizon—a Wyvern is on the hunt for flesh. Stella hadn’t\nmentioned anything about Wyverns being active in this\narea, so she decides it’s appropriate to spend a Fear rather\nthan introduce the new threat with a normal GM move in\nresponse to the player’s roll.\nExample 4: The party is facing off with a group of bandits\ntrying to steal a treasure chest the group is transporting.\nTabby, the warrior, just succeeded on an attack roll with\nFear against one of their adversaries. Because Tabby rolled\nwith Fear, play passes to the GM after Tabby deals damage.\nStella has 10 Fear in her pool and decides to spend three to\nstart the battle off strong. On the battlefield, there are two\nribbet Bandits and a group of five Bandit Minions.\nStella uses her move to spotlight the first Bandit, describing\nher leaping down from a tree to slide beneath the party’s\nwagon and break some of the wooden floorboards to get to\nthe treasure inside.\nStella then spends a Fear to spotlight the second Bandit, a\nlarge, bullfrog-like figure with heavy armor. They leap down\nto put themselves between a few members of the party and\nswing a massive hammer, using their “Better Surrounded”\naction to hit all targets in range of their weapon. Stella rolls\nagainst the PCs’ Evasion and succeeds. They then roll the\nadversary’s damage dice and deal 12 physical damage to\neach target.\nFinally, Stella spends 2 Fear, the first to shift the spotlight\nto one of the Bandit Minions, and the second to use their\n“Group Attack” action (which costs a Fear to activate). This\nputs the spotlight on all five Minions, who move into Melee\nrange of Tabby. Stella makes an attack, describing the scene\nand rolling against Tabby’s Evasion. Stella succeeds, so the\nbandits deals 3 damage each for a total of 15 damage to\nTabby. Tabby has no Armor Slots left, so she takes Major\ndamage—marking 2 Hit Points.\nStella has 7 Fear left but no more adversaries to spotlight,\nso Stella returns play to the PCs.\n156 \tChapter 3: Core GM Mechanics\n\n-- 157 of 415 --\n\nSETTING ROLL DIFFICULTY\nWhen a player makes an action roll, you’ll often have to set the\nDifficulty of that challenge to know whether they’ve succeeded\nor failed. Setting a target number for Difficulty can feel like it\nrelies on a lot of factors, but it’s best not to overcomplicate\nthe question: how hard is the task they’re trying to accomplish\nin this scene? Use the following rubric as a general guideline\nwhen setting Difficulty.\nVERY\nEASY \tEASY \tAVERAGE \tHARD \tVERY\nHARD\nNEARLY\nIMPOSSIBLE\n5 \t30\t25\t20\t15\t10\nDifficulty doesn’t need to be a multiple of\n5, so feel free to choose numbers between\ntwo of the rubric options. Additionally,\nwhile most Difficulties fall between 5 and\n30, you can select numbers outside that\nrange to fit the story. You can choose to\nkeep this Difficulty secret or tell the player\nwhat they’re aiming for up front; both\nplaystyles work well in Daggerheart.\nDEGREES OF SUCCESS AND FAILURE\nOften, instead of setting a single value for success, you might\ninstead give a player different outcomes based on the relative\nsuccess or failure of their roll This tactic is especially useful\non rolls to inspect an area, recall something from the past,\nor persuade an NPC to surrender information. Simply pick a\ntarget number and scale the amount of information you give\nthem up or down based on the player’s relative roll result.\nDIFFICULTY ROLLS\nWhen a PC rolls against an adversary, the stat block provides\na Difficulty for the roll. However, if an NPC doesn’t have a\nstat block—or if you like the unpredictability of rolling—\nyou can have that NPC make a roll to determine what the\nDifficulty would be. Though this can add to the time it takes\nto resolve the scene, it can also be a useful tool in situations\nwhere you’re unsure what the Difficulty should be. To make a\nDifficulty Roll, roll a d20 and add any relevant Experience the\nNPC or adversary has to its total.\nTip: Attack rolls against adversaries use that stat block’s\nassigned Difficulty. For other PC action rolls, it’s often easiest\nto add the relevant Experience to the adversary’s current\nDifficulty to determine the new Difficulty.\n157\tChapter 3: Core GM Mechanics\n\n-- 158 of 415 --\n\nEXAMPLE DIFFICULTY\nIncluded here are Difficulty examples for each trait. Don’t feel the need to refer to these during play—just use them to get a\nsense for how Difficulty works so you can make judgment calls on the fly as your players take actions.\nExample Difficulty

it seems appropriate within the bounds of the\nnarrative, you can give a PC advantage or disadvantage on\na roll. This tool explicitly shows a player that the situation\nis helpful or harmful to the action they’re attempting. For\nexample, if a player is attempting to sprint through deep mud\nor knee-high water, you might impose disadvantage on their\nAgility Roll. If they say something clever to a guard or use\nknowledge they obtained from an NPC about their captor, you\nmight grant advantage on their Presence Roll.\nNPC ADVANTAGE AND DISADVANTAGE\nIf an NPC has advantage, roll an extra d20 and take the\nhighest result. Similarly, if an NPC has disadvantage, roll\nan extra d20 and use the lowest result. Some PC abilities\ncan impose disadvantage on an NPC’s roll, or you might\nchoose to give an NPC advantage or disadvantage due to the\ncircumstances of the narrative.\nADVANTAGE VS. DIFFICULTY\nBecause you control both Difficulty and advantage or\ndisadvantage, why not just raise or lower the Difficulty of a roll\ninstead? You certainly can, but advantage and disadvantage\nallow the characters’ actions and circumstances to modify\nhow successful they are at interacting with the world in a\ntangible way. Players feel the advantage through rolling extra\ndice, while a disadvantage conveys a difficult situation on both\na mechanical and narrative level.\nExample: “For any standard adventurer, it would be a\nDifficulty of 15 to sneak by the Head Guard without being\nnoticed. But, because you knocked out one of their lackeys\nand stole their attire, you gain advantage on a Presence Roll\nto sneak by them without catching their eye.”\nADVERSARY ROLLS\nAdversaries aren’t limited to just the attacks and unique actions in their stat blocks; those represent their special abilities,\nbut they can do most anything a PC would do, such as picking a lock or climbing a cliff. However, other than the attack rolls\ndescribed in the next section, adversaries don’t typically make action rolls.\nWhen you want an adversary’s action to have a chance of failure, you can offer the PCs the opportunity to make a reaction roll\nor otherwise respond to the situation. This highlights the agency of the PCs and keeps the story focused on them. For example,\nwhen a Kraken attacks the party’s boat to throw them into the sea, you might have the PCs all make a Strength or Agility\nReaction Roll to see if they’re able to keep themselves from falling overboard. For dramatic or difficult tasks that the PCs can’t\ninfluence, you might want to roll to see if the adversary succeeds. To do so, spend a Fear to utilize any relevant Experience the\nadversary might have, then roll a d20. These rolls are more interesting if you tell the players the Difficulty and roll where they\ncan see the result.\nADVERSARY ATTACK ROLLS\nWhen an adversary you’re controlling attacks a PC, you’ll make a simplified version of the attack roll made by players. Every\nadversary can make normal attacks using the weapon in their stat block, and some adversaries can also use special moves\nto attack.\nStep 1: Choose Dice\nYou make your attack roll with a d20. If the adversary has\nadvantage or disadvantage on the attack, add an extra d20\nto that roll.\nStep 2: Find the Attack Modifier\nUnlike PCs, adversaries don’t use traits on their attacks;\ninstead, the stat block’s Attack Modifier is the value added\nto or subtracted from the adversary’s attack roll. You can\nalso spend a Fear to add an adversary’s Experience to the\nroll’s result. Set aside a number of character tokens equal\nto the Attack Modifier and any applicable Experience you\nhave spent Fear to add.\nStep 3: Roll the Dice\nOnce you’ve gathered your dice and tokens for the Attack\nModifier, roll them all at the same time. Counting each\ntoken as 1 (or −1 for a negative modifier), add the tokens\nand dice roll result together to determine the total. If you\nrolled with advantage (or disadvantage), don’t count both\nd20s, only the highest (or lowest) one.\nStep 4: Resolve the Situation\nShare your roll total with the player who was attacked\nand compare it against their Evasion. If the attack meets\nor beats that value, it is successful and deals the damage\nindicated in the stat block for that attack. If it rolls below\ntheir Evasion, the attack misses and no damage is dealt;\ninvite the player to describe how they avoided the blow.\n160 \tChapter 3: Core GM Mechanics\n\n-- 161 of 415 --\n\nAttacking Multiple Targets\nBy default, an adversary can only hit one target with their\nstandard attack. When an adversary’s action lets you make an\nattack against multiple targets, you make one attack roll and\nask if it hits any of the targets. If you are making individual\nattacks with multiple adversaries during the same GM move,\nmake an attack roll for each adversary.\nAttack Rolls as Story\nEvery attack roll is an opportunity for you to show how that\nattack changes the scene. When your attack roll hits, you’re\ntaking away resources from the PCs (Hit Points, Stress, Armor\nSlots, etc.), so ensure you provide context for that depletion\nin the fiction. When your roll is a failure, it’s an opportunity to\ncelebrate the prowess of the PC and ask the player to describe\nhow their character avoids the attack.\nIf a player isn’t sure how to describe their Evasion, remind\nthem it’s not just about how quick a character is, it’s about\nhow skilled they are at not getting hit. This could manifest as\nthe sorcerer reaching out and stopping an arrow mid-flight or\nthe wizard throwing up a magical barrier. It could be the rogue\ntransforming into a swirling mass of darkness and letting the\naxe pass through them, a ranger backflipping out of the way,\nor anything else that aligns with the character they built.\nADVERSARY REACTION ROLLS\nSome PC moves can force an adversary or other NPC to make\na reaction roll. When this occurs, roll a d20 to determine\nwhether they succeed or fail. If you meet or exceed the roll’s\nDifficulty, the NPC succeeds and avoids the consequences. If\nthey roll below the target number, the NPC fails and suffers\nthe consequences.\nBecause NPCs don’t have character traits like\nPCs do, you can spend a Fear to add any of the\nadversary’s relevant Experiences as a bonus\nto their reaction roll.\nExample: Rune is chasing a Masked Thief and unleashes\nthe Fireball spell to slow them down. The Masked Thief has\nthe very relevant Experience of Acrobatics +3, so the GM\nspends a Fear and adds +3 to the reaction roll.\nOn the other hand, if you feel like the adversary would be\nparticularly weak against the PC’s move, you can instead\nimpose a penalty on the adversary’s roll.\nExample: Rune the wizard casts Fireball on a Zombie Pack\nand their commander, a Skeleton Knight. The Difficulty on\nthe reaction roll is 13. The GM rules that a Zombie Pack\nis particularly ill-prepared to avoid a fireball, as they’re\nweak against fire and unlikely to dodge quickly, so the GM\nimposes a −3 penalty on the roll.\nThe GM rolls a d20 for the Zombie Pack and gets a 13. With\nthe −3 penalty, they fail and take full damage. The GM rolls\nagain for the Skeleton Knight and gets an 18, which passes\nthe reaction roll. The Skeleton Knight takes half damage per\nthe mechanics of the Fireball spell.\nCLASS HOPE FEATURES\nEach class has a Hope Feature that requires 3 Hope to use;\nwhenever a PC uses this unique and powerful feature, ensure\nthat it impacts the scene. Draw attention to the ferocity and\nstrength of the druid’s empowered Beastform, encourage the\nguardian to describe their burning determination as they patch\ntheir armor and fight on—these are your heroes’ powerful\nfeatures, so yield the stage to the player to affect the fiction\nand describe how their PC’s Hope changes fate.\n161\tChapter 3: Core GM Mechanics\n\n-- 162 of 415 --\n\nCOUNTDOWNS\nYou can use a countdown to track progress toward an event,\nconsequence, or adversary move. Some stat blocks and\nadventures specifically call for a countdown, but feel free to\nuse them in any scene you wish.\nCOUNTDOWN DIE\nWhen you want to represent the passage of time or events\nleading to a dramatic climax—such as an impending\nadversary move or a significant narrative event—you can\nuse your d20 or another die as a countdown die to track that\nprogression. Choose a die with your desired starting value\non it and put it on the table with that number facing up. For\nexample, if your starting value is 5, you can use a d6 set to 5\nas your countdown die.\nEach time the countdown ticks down, turn the die to reduce\nits value by one. When the countdown ticks down from 1 to\n0 (which doesn’t appear on the die), the countdown ends and\ntriggers the event you were counting down to. If you ever need\nto continue a countdown across sessions, record the current\ncountdown value so you can continue counting next session.\nIf you don’t want to use dice to track your countdowns, you\ncan alternatively draw a number of small boxes equal to the\nstarting value and fill them in as the countdown progresses.\nUSING A COUNTDOWN\nWhen you introduce a countdown, you can either directly tell\nthe players you’ve done so (“I’m starting a countdown to when\nthe army attacks—what do you want to do before then?”)\nor imply it through your narration (“The bridge is starting\nto crack, and it won’t last long.”). It’s up to you whether you\nkeep the countdown die visible to the players (increasing the\ntension each time it ticks down) or secretly use it to track an\nevent they can’t predict.\nWhen you’re designing a countdown (or using one from an\nadversary stat block), consider three elements:\n• Activation: What moment in the fiction prompts you to\nactivate the countdown? For example, a countdown might\nactivate when the PCs stealthily enter an enemy camp.\n• Advancement: When does the countdown advance,\nprompting you to tick down the die by 1? For example, a\ncountdown might advance whenever a PC makes an action\nroll, or it might advance only on certain roll results.\n• Effect: What happens when the countdown ends? For\nexample, a countdown might trigger a powerful enemy\nattack or a wave of allies arriving to save the day.\nSTANDARD COUNTDOWN\nMany adversaries and events use a standard countdown,\nin which the die begins on a specific number (such as\n“Countdown 4”) and ticks down every time a player makes an\naction roll, regardless of the result. When the countdown die\nreaches 0, the countdown’s effect triggers immediately after\nthe last action roll is resolved.\n• Short countdowns (2–4) work well when you want a move\nor event to quickly trigger in an encounter regardless of\nhow the players roll. If you want the countdown speed to\nvary with the players’ rolls, see the following “Dynamic\nCountdowns” section.\n• Longer countdowns (5 or higher) are best used for\npowerful moves or events that you want to build across\nthe length of an entire scene.\nWhile in combat, standard countdowns for adversary\nmoves are usually reserved for the major antagonist.\nRunning multiple countdowns at once can be complex, so\nmost encounters include no more than one adversary with\ncountdowns.\nDYNAMIC COUNTDOWN\nWhen a situation is being actively influenced by the players,\nyou may choose to use a dynamic countdown to track it.\nUnlike standard countdowns, this doesn’t tick down every\ntime a player rolls—instead, it’s influenced by the outcome\nof their rolls or choices. Dynamic countdowns can be used\nto track larger-scale events or situations happening in the\nbackground of a complex scene. Typically, these countdowns\nhave a starting value of 5–10.\nFor example, if the PCs are trying to destroy a wall or another\nobject that doesn’t have Hit Points, a dynamic countdown\ncan track how close they are to destroying it. Similarly, if\nthe party’s skyship is under attack, you could use a dynamic\ncountdown to track their escape. If the PCs are chasing or\nsearching for an enemy, the countdown can track how close\nthe PCs are to catching them.\nMost dynamic countdowns can be categorized as either a\nprogress countdown (if players are working toward a desired\noutcome) or a consequence countdown (if players are trying\nto avoid a dreaded outcome). The Dynamic Countdown\nAdvancement table suggests how much to tick down the\ncountdown die each time a PC makes an action roll.\n162 \tChapter 3: Core GM Mechanics\n\n-- 163 of 415 --\n\nDynamic Countdown Advancement\nRoll\nResult\nProgress\nAdvancement\nConsequence\nAdvancement\nFailure with Fear \tNo advancement \tTick down 3\nFailure with\nHope\nNo advancement \tTick down 2\nSuccess with\nFear\nTick down 1 \tTick down 1\nSuccess with\nHope\nTick down 2 \tNo advancement\nCritical Success \tTick down 3 \tNo advancement\nADVANCED COUNTDOWN FEATURES\nYou can use the following additional features to make\ncountdowns more complex or unique.\nRandomized Starting Value\nInstead of assigning a starting value, a countdown might\ninstead use a randomized value. For example, a “Countdown\n(1d6)” means that you roll 1d6 and use the result as the\ncountdown’s starting value. Randomized countdowns are\nmost commonly used when you want the timing to be\nunpredictable—usually to keep the PCs on their toes.\nLoop\nSome countdowns loop after they trigger; this is common with\nadversaries who can recharge a feature over time. After this\ntype of countdown triggers and you apply its effects, it resets\nto its starting value and begins counting down again. For\nexample, “Countdown (Loop 5)” resets after 5 ticks.\nIncreasing or Decreasing\nSome countdowns repeat like loops, but the starting value,\nand thus the timing between them, increases or decreases\nwith each loop, reflecting a narrative event that changes\nfrequency.\nEach time an increasing countdown triggers and resets,\nits starting value increases by 1. For example, “Countdown\n(Increasing 8)” begins at 8, then after its effect triggers, the\nstarting value resets to 9, then 10, and so on.\nSimilarly, each time a decreasing countdown triggers, its\nstarting value decreases by 1. For example, “Countdown\n(Decreasing 8)” begins at 8, then resets to 7, then 6, and so\non. Once a decreasing countdown reaches 0, a major event\ntriggers—maybe a cave the PCs are struggling to escape from\nfinally collapses, or a ship they’re trying to keep afloat sinks\nbeneath the waves.\nCHASE COUNTDOWNS\nYou can use dynamic countdowns to track the progress of\na chase scene, whether the PCs are pursuing an NPC or\nbeing pursued themselves. When the chase begins, set two\ncountdowns: one for the pursuing party and one for the\nescaping party. First pick a die for the pursuers’ countdown—\nthe more time you want the chase to take, the higher the\nstarting value should be—then set that die at its highest\nvalue. Next, select another die with the same starting value for\nthe escapee’s countdown, but set that die at a lower value to\nreflect how much of a lead they have (1 lower for a small lead,\n3 lower for a decent lead, 5 lower for a substantial lead).\nFor example, a chase through a town market could use d6 dice\nand each tick of the countdown could represent one range\nband (Very Close to Close, Close to Far, Far to Very Far, etc.).\nFor a chase playing out over a longer distance, such as the\nPCs pursuing bandits across the countryside, each tick on the\ncountdown might represent several miles.\nRegardless of whether the PCs are pursuing or escaping,\ntheir action rolls advance both countdowns, as shown on the\nearlier Dynamic Countdown Advancement table. When a PC\nsucceeds on an action roll, it ticks down their countdown,\nwhich is a progress countdown. When they fail on an action\nroll—or roll a success with Fear—it ticks down the other\nparty’s countdown, which is a consequence countdown. When\nsetting the Difficulty of these rolls, consider the adversary’s\nDifficulty plus any other narrative considerations.\nExample: A thief has stolen Rune’s wizard spellbook and\nnow the PCs are chasing them across a market square. The\nGM, Stella, decides on a d6 for the pursuing PCs’ progress\ncountdown, then sets up the thief’s countdown—a\nconsequence countdown—by taking another d6 and setting\nits starting value to 3, since the thief has a slight head start.\nThe warrior, Tabby, asks to go first, clambering up onto the\nmarket stall tents to run over the top rather than pushing\nthrough the crowds. Stella calls for an Agility Roll against the\nthief’s Difficulty of 15, and Aliyah uses Tabby’s Second-Story\nTraveler Experience to get a bonus. Quinn spends a Hope to\nHelp an Ally, describing how Shepherd channels their affinity\nwith air to boost Tabby up. With the help of Shepherd’s\nd6 advantage die, Tabby rolls a success with Hope, so\nStella ticks the PC’s progress countdown from 6 to 4; this\nrepresents Tabby gaining on the thief and helping the group\ncatch up by calling out a quicker route through the crowd.\nNext, Rune wants to take things into his own hands. Using\nhis Book of Sitil grimoire, he describes how he conjures\nan illusion of a runaway horse charging across the thief’s\npath, forcing them to slow down rather than get trampled.\nRune makes a Spellcast Roll against Difficulty 15, but rolls\na failure with Fear. Stella describes the thief seeing through\nthe illusion at the last moment and ducks through a busy\ncrowd that blocks the party’s path. Stella ticks the thief’s\nconsequence countdown down from 3 to 1 as the thief\nmakes it to Far range away from the party. The thief is\neluding their sight and in real danger of getting away—if\nthe consequence countdown ticks down one more time,\nthe thief will be gone.\n163\tChapter 3: Core GM Mechanics\n\n-- 164 of 415 --\n\nLONG-TERM COUNTDOWNS\nCountdowns can also be used to track long-term events\nduring a campaign; you could count down toward a nation\nbeing overthrown, the death of a powerful mage, or another\nmomentous event that might take more than a few sessions to\ncome to fruition.\nWhile you can use a die for long-term countdowns, it’s often\neasier to make a countdown track to record progress across\nmultiple sessions. To do so, decide how far out the event\nshould be (usually between 4 and 12 ticks) and, on a piece of\npaper, create small boxes for each tick. Starting from the first\nand working towards the last, write some events that may\noccur along the way that foreshadow the final event. These\nsteps can alternate between softer and harder moves to give\na sense of variety and growing tension. Adding unique events\nthroughout the story ensures the countdown is always present\nduring play, even if the final result is many sessions away.\nAdvancing a Long-Term Countdown\nDuring a short rest, you should generally tick a relevant\nlong-term countdown once. During a long rest, you should\ngenerally tick down a relevant long-term countdown twice.\nWhen you tick the countdown, let the consequences ripple\ndown to the PCs, building tension as events unfold. Often,\nyou can reveal this progression through something the PCs\nwitness, such as the banner of a rival leader recently hung\non the castle or conversations in the marketplace about the\nstrange lights NPCs saw in the sky last night. Other times, you\nmight cinematically cut away to a scene the PCs are unaware\nof, narrating the events to the players. This is best done\nwhen the characters know about the events surrounding the\ncountdown so players aren’t asked to completely ignore\nout-of-character knowledge.\nExample Long-Term Countdown\nEarly in the campaign, the party crossed paths with Marius, a\ngalapa mercenary captain. The group suspected Marius would\ncause trouble, but pressing matters drew them elsewhere\nin the kingdom. Meanwhile, Marius makes a deal with an\nexpansionist theocracy to the east—an action the party’s\nseraph may well view with concern because of her past with\nthe theocracy. In exchange for helping the theocrats invade,\nMarius will be appointed as governor of a prosperous county\nonce the kingdom falls.\nThe GM wants this invasion to ramp up pretty quickly, so\nthey set the countdown’s starting value to 8, drawing eight\ncheckboxes as a countdown tracker. Next to each checkbox,\nthe GM plans out story beats that represent the countdown’s\nadvancement.\nEXAMPLE: COUNTDOWN TRACKER\n8 The deal is struck and Marius’s company mobilizes.\n7 Marius’s company raids a border town.\n6 The theocracy’s troops gather at the border.*\n5 Marius’s company captures a different border town,\nhaving misdirected nearby militias.\n4 The theocracy’s army marches into the kingdom,\nestablishing a beachhead in the captured town.\n3 Refugees flee the region around the border town,\nbringing news of the invasion with them to larger\nsettlements.*\n2 Marius harries the kingdom’s army to give the theocracy\ntime to establish supply lines.\n1 The theocracy rededicates a temple in the captured\ntown to their god, magnifying their priests’ power in the\nkingdom.\n0 The invasion becomes an all-out war, with Marius’s and\nthe theocracy’s army executing coordinated strikes to\ndivide the kingdom’s defenders.\nThe GM identifies steps 6 and 3, marked with *, as prime\ncandidates for steps where news would reach the party.\nThis gives the PCs at least two clear prompts to get involved\nbefore the invasion escalates to a full-blown war. Depending\non the party’s movements and location as the countdown\nprogresses, the GM can bring the edges of the invasion to the\nparty’s horizon—or their doorstep.\n164 \tChapter 3: Core GM Mechanics\n\n-- 165 of 415 --\n\nGOLD, EQUIPMENT, AND LOOT\nIt’s up to you and your players how much importance you want\nto place on gold, equipment, and loot in your campaign.\nYour players might operate as a band of thieves who rob their\nadversaries, a group of spiritual devotees who abstain from\nacquiring possessions, or a company of adventurers whose\napproach to wealth and possessions lands somewhere in the\nmiddle. You can also utilize wealth and equipment to adjust\nthe dial between realism and fantasy. If your game has a\nmore survivalist tone and players need gold to buy food, their\ninteractions with opportunities to acquire wealth will be very\ndifferent than if you handwave the cost of rations.\nDISTRIBUTING GOLD\nUsing gold as a quest reward can give your players a fun way\nto procure new equipment for future adventures. This book\nleaves the price of items up to you, allowing you to decide\nhow much importance you want to place on gold in your\ncampaign and how costly individual items are if and when\nthey become available.\nIf you don’t want to worry about gold in your campaign, you\ncan let PCs shop by abstracting payment and letting each\nplayer choose one or two items. When you do this, rather than\nletting them choose from every item, you can encourage them\nto shop around by only offering a few items that make sense\nfor that location, have bonuses and abilities you want to make\navailable, or fit your party’s tastes and goals.\nIf you’d rather gold play a larger role in your game, the following\nsections provide further guidance on pricing equipment.\nDISTRIBUTING EQUIPMENT\nAt character creation, players can choose from the starting\nweapons and armor. The remainder of the equipment is\norganized by rarity and should be made available to players\nas the party journeys through the campaign. For example,\nyou can stock a few options in shops along the PCs’ journey,\nprovide equipment as part of an NPC’s reward, or allow them\nto pull weapons and armor off of the adversaries they’ve\ndefeated. The average costs of items and services can be\nfound on the Average Costs table in the upcoming “Economy\nof Your World” section.\nYou can raise the price of weapons and armor with unique\nmagical qualities or worldbuilding implications. For example,\narmor the PCs can use to disguise themselves or an enchanted\nsword that has been outlawed in a specific region will fetch a\nhigher price.\nRegardless of how you treat the overall economy in your\ncampaign, keep in mind how common a weapon or armor is\nin a particular city or region—and how generous or stingy a\nparticular shopkeeper might be.\nDISTRIBUTING LOOT\nThe tables of items and consumables in chapter 2 are\norganized to help you distribute loot based on its prevalence\nand impact. The lower the number of an item or consumable\non a list, the less it tends to impact play and the more\ncommonly it can be found in a typical fantasy economy.\nConsumables are fun to use and less powerful than\npermanent items, so you can offer common consumables\npretty regularly during a campaign. Outside of buying them\nfrom shops along the way, you might consider having an NPC\noffer a bundle of consumables as a gesture of good faith to get\nin the PCs’ good graces, or scattering a few around an enemy\ncamp for the PCs to pick up as they sneak through. When\nthe campaign nears its climax or you want to highlight an\nimportant moment, you might find a narrative reason to give\nthe PCs a few rare or legendary consumables and items.\nYou’re highly encouraged to make your own items and\nconsumables for your campaign to personalize it for your story.\nLike other equipment, loot has no set gold cost; instead, the\ncost should reflect how often you’re giving gold as a reward, as\nwell as how commonplace that loot might be locally.\nECONOMY OF YOUR WORLD\nThe following table provides examples of the average cost of\nbasic goods and services. However, your world’s economy\nshould reflect how important gold is to your campaign, so\ndon’t be afraid to adjust these prices accordingly.\nAverage Costs\nPurchase \tGold\nMeals for a party of adventurers per night \t1 Handful\nStandard inn room per night \t1 Handful\nLuxury inn room per night \t1 Bag\nCarriage ride \t2 Handfuls\nMount (horse, mule, etc.) \t3 Bags\nSpecialized tools \t3 Handfuls\nFine clothing \t3 Handfuls\nLuxury clothing \t1 Bag\nTier 1 equipment (weapons, armor) \t1–5 Handfuls\nTier 2 equipment (weapons, armor) \t1–2 Bags\nTier 3 equipment (weapons, armor) \t5–10 Bags\nTier 4 equipment (weapons, armor) \t1–2 Chests\n165\tChapter 3: Gold, Equipment and Loot\n\n-- 166 of 415 --\n\nRUNNING GM NPCS\nWhen you run NPCs as the GM, you should always strive to follow your GM principles and use them to bring the world to life.\nDifferentiate each character by the unique ways they speak and act—you can use a new voice, posture, or set of mannerisms if\nyou’re comfortable—and lean into their individual motives to fill the world with dynamic, active NPCs.\nCHOOSING NPC STATISTICS\nMany NPCs don’t need page-long backstories or their own stat\nblock—if the PCs are simply interacting with a friendly bar\npatron to gather information, you probably just need a name,\ndescription, and motive. These three things give the NPC a\nmoniker, a way to recognize them, and a purpose behind their\nactions. If they’re someone the PCs might try to make a roll\nagainst, consider also giving them a Difficulty. You can use the\nexamples in the earlier “Setting Roll Difficulty” section or base\nit on similar NPCs you’ve already introduced.\nIf you’re improvising a creature who isn’t interacting with\nthe party socially, it’s still important to think about motive,\nbut you’ll want to focus more on the information needed to\nplay them in battle. You can grab an adversary stat block of a\nsimilar creature and make some changes—or if you prefer,\nimprovise your own using the guidance in the “Improvising\nAdversaries” section of chapter 4, then decide their features\nwhen you have the chance to make a GM move. That allows\nyou to choose something that will have the most interesting\nimpact on the scene at that moment.\nUSING NPC ALLIES\nNPCs can also become allies in a fight. If this happens, you\ndon’t need a stat block for them—instead, put the spotlight\non them and what they do, showing how the fiction changes\nbecause they’re involved. When they act to help the PCs, and\nif a PC capitalizes on that help during their next action, give\nthe PC advantage on the roll.\nEven if an NPC doesn’t have Hit Points or Stress, they aren’t\nimmune to danger and tragedy—they can get seriously\ninjured or even die as a result of the narrative. During your GM\nmove, don’t be afraid to capture and threaten the NPC to drive\nthe PCs to action, trap the NPC and force the PCs to make a\ndifficult choice, or push on the NPC’s motive so hard that they\ndo something that endangers everyone. When it’s justified,\nhit the NPC hard. Allow them to be beaten and broken after\na difficult fight, or have them die in the party’s arms if the\nnarrative says they should. You run both the adversaries and\nNPCs—you control their story and fate. Follow the fiction,\nembrace your GM principles, and make moves that drive\ninteresting conflict for the party.\n166 \tChapter 3: Running GM NPCs\n\n-- 167 of 415 --\n\nNPC FEATURES\nIf you want an important NPC to mechanically interact with\nthe system, you can give them one or more features that\nreflect how they move through the world. At your discretion,\nyou can share these NPC features openly with your table,\nallowing players to help keep track of them, or keep them\nprivate, so an NPC’s actions feel more organic and\nnarrative-focused.\nAn NPC feature works similarly to an adversary’s reaction, but\nit is broken down into the trigger and the effect. The trigger\nis the event that makes the NPC behave in a certain way, and\nthe effect is what mechanically occurs because of that trigger.\nFor example:\nNot On My Watch\nTrigger: A PC within Very Close range marks at least 2 Hit\nPoints.\nEffect: Roll 1d8. On a 4 or higher, this NPC moves into Melee\nrange of the PC and marks one of the Hit Points instead.\nReduce the die size by 1 (from 1d8 to 1d6, then 1d6 to 1d4).\nOnce you must reduce the die below 1d4, this feature can’t\nbe used again until this NPC finishes a long rest.\nIn this example, any PCs within the NPC’s Very Close range\nhave a chance of taking less damage because of the ally, but\nif they do, the odds of that NPC being able to reduce damage\nagain decrease. Once the NPC can no longer trigger the effect,\nthey can’t use that feature until they rest and recover.\nThese triggers and effects are designed so you can include\nother mechanics alongside them—such as countdowns,\nrolling dice, and dealing damage—to represent an NPC’s\ncomplex and dynamic interactions with the world. On the flip\nside, you can also tailor these elements to be as narrative-\nforward as needed for your playstyle and table.\nOptionally, an NPC might also have a choice. The choice\nrepresents a specific parameter by which the trigger and\neffect will operate. For example:\nArcane Hold\nChoice: When the battle begins, choose a favored PC.\nTrigger: The first time during a battle the favored PC is\nwithin Close range and hit with an attack.\nEffect: Make an attack roll with a +6 modifier against\nthe adversary. On a success, the target is temporarily\nRestrained by tendrils of powerful magic.\nThe following NPC feature examples showcase the different\nways you can approach this mechanic. Use them as inspiration\nto build your own for NPCs in your campaign. If the effect ever\ncalls for an attack roll or action roll, roll your d20 (just like\nwith adversaries).\nADDITIONAL NPC FEATURE\nEXAMPLES\nVolley of Arrows\nTrigger: A battle begins and this NPC is involved.\nEffect: Activate a countdown (Loop 3). It ticks down\nwhen a PC misses an attack. When it triggers, this\nNPC releases a volley of arrows at a target of the\nPCs’ choice, dealing 2d8+3 physical damage.\nMentor\nChoice: When the battle begins, choose a\nprotégé PC.\nTrigger: Your protégé is within Close range and fails\nan attack roll.\nEffect: Move into Melee range with the PC and give\nthem advice or guidance. The next attack roll they\nmake has advantage.\nRegroup\nChoice: When a battle begins, choose a point within\nFar range.\nTrigger: All PCs have marked all of their Armor\nSlots.\nEffect: Teleport all PCs and this NPC to the chosen\nspot and clear an Armor Slot on each target.\nInto the Night\nTrigger: The PCs start a long rest with this NPC.\nEffect: Roll 1d4. On a 2 or less, this NPC steals\n1 handful of gold from the party while they are\nsleeping, then disappears into the night.\nIt’s good practice to limit the number of active NPCs with\nfeatures, as they can quickly become overwhelming to\ntrack, especially in battle. We recommended using them\nonly as needed, prioritizing very important or reoccuring\nNPCs.\n167\tChapter 3: Running GM NPCs\n\n-- 168 of 415 --\n\nOPTIONAL GM MECHANICS\nThe following sections describe optional GM mechanics you\ncan choose to implement if you or your table would enjoy them.\nFATE ROLLS\nWhen narrating a moment outside the PCs’ influence, the\nGM might wish to leave the outcome up to chance. In these\nsituations, you can use a fate roll, asking a player to roll only\ntheir Hope or Fear Die to decide the result. Your choice of\ndie doesn’t affect the outcome, nor does the roll result grant\nHope or Fear—the die type simply helps add flavor to the roll.\nYou might roll the Hope Die in lucky circumstances or to see\nif fortune smiles upon the character, while the Fear Die can\nbe used to decide whether a hazard comes into play or how\ndangerous a situation becomes.\nWhen making a fate roll, you can declare what event occurs if\nthe result falls within a certain number range or determine the\noutcome based on how high or low the result is.\n“Roll your Fear Die. On a 4 or lower, the fire spreads beyond\nthis house.”\n“I think it’s really up to chance whether reinforcements will\nmake it to you in time. Go ahead and roll your Fear Die—\nthat’ll determine the starting size of the countdown. When\nthat triggers, reinforcements will arrive in your Far range.”\n“Go ahead and roll your Hope Die to see how big the crowd\nat the inn is tonight. The higher the roll, the bigger the\ncrowd.”\n“Make a roll using your Hope Die to determine the number\nof Stamina Potions the shop has in stock.”\nFALLING AND COLLISION DAMAGE\nIf a character falls to the ground, you can use the following as\na guide to determine the damage they take:\n• A fall from Very Close range deals 1d10+3 physical\ndamage.\n• A fall from Close range deals 1d20+5 physical damage.\n• A fall from Far or Very Far range deals 1d100+15 physical\ndamage, or death at the GM’s discretion.\nIf a character collides with an object or another character at a\ndangerous speed, they take 1d20+5 direct physical damage.\nYou can always increase or decrease the damage dice to fit\nthe story.\nMOVING AND FIGHTING UNDERWATER\nAttack rolls underwater have disadvantage unless it makes\nsense for a character to easily fight underwater, like a Siren\nor Shark making an attack on a PC.\nFor any creatures that can’t breathe underwater, you can use\na countdown to create tension about how long they can hold\ntheir breath. Set the countdown die’s starting value to 3 or\nhigher and tick down as follows:\n• Tick down once whenever any PC takes an action\nunderwater.\n• If an action roll is a failure or with Fear, you can use your\nmove to tick it down an additional time. (If the roll is both\na failure and with Fear, you can tick it twice instead.)\nOnce the countdown ends, a PC underwater must mark a\nStress whenever they take an action.\nCONFLICT BETWEEN PCS\nSometimes a player might want their character to act against\nanother PC in the scene. Before jumping to rolling dice,\ndiscuss the situation with both players to decide how to\nresolve the conflict. A roll might not be necessary to reach\nan outcome—but if rolling will be fun for everyone involved,\ncome to a consensus on the terms of the roll, then facilitate\nthe scene according to the results.\nOn an attack roll against a PC, the attacker rolls against the\ndefender’s Evasion, just like an adversary. On any other kind\nof action roll, the instigator makes an action roll and the target\nmakes a reaction roll. To succeed, the instigator must beat a\nDifficulty equal to the total value of the reaction roll.\n168 \tChapter 3: Optional GM Mechanics\n\n-- 169 of 415 --\n\nSession Zero and Safety Tools\nWhen preparing to embark on a long campaign that will span months or years, it’s important to\nget everyone on the same page by setting expectations as early as possible.\nLAYING THE GROUNDWORK\nIf you were creating an epic fantasy TV show, you’d prepare\nvia the preproduction process: the creator and showrunner\nwould build the writers’ room, work with the producers and\nheads of departments to develop the look, feel, and vision\nfor the series, and so on. If you were writing an epic fantasy\nbook series, you might accomplish this by worldbuilding and\ndeveloping characters, researching the genre, making a mood\nboard, and outlining the book.\nMany tabletop roleplaying games do this via a session zero.\nThis term means different things to different people, but\nfor Daggerheart, it’s how you set up your group to tell a\nsuccessful fantasy epic together. Before making characters or\ndeciding on the setting, the group talks about what everyone\nwants from this experience.\nThe GM facilitates session zero, but all players should be\nactive participants, advocating for what they do and don’t\nwant from the campaign.\nThere are many tools for structuring your session zero. If\neveryone in your group has played together before, you may\nalready have a method for conducting this process. If you\nhaven’t done a session zero before or want to explore another\nprocess, the following sections offer suggestions.\nAn essential part of session zero is choosing your game’s\ncontent and safety tools. These tools ensure players know\nthey can avoid material that would be hurtful or upsetting—\nand beyond that, safety tools empower players to explore\nchallenging subjects everyone has signed up to engage\nwith (to be what we’d call “comfortably uncomfortable”). In\naddition, these tools help the GM and players communicate\nduring play. In improvisation, there is always the chance\nthat something unexpectedly troubling comes up, or the\nparticipants need help remembering what story elements the\ngroup is avoiding or keeping “off-screen.” Safety tools give\nstructure to pregame conversations and tools for working\nthrough mid-game hurdles.\nWe recommend the following tools:\nCATS\nOne of many frameworks for discussing content and safety\nis the CATS Method. This framework presents four elements\nto discuss with your players to decide what the group wants\nfrom the game:\n→ Concept\n→ Aim\n→ Tone\n→ Subject\nCONCEPT\nDiscuss the concept for the campaign—what’s the big-picture\npitch? If this campaign was a book series, how would you hype\nit up to a friend you know would love it? Getting yourself and\nthe group excited about a campaign’s concept is a great way\nto set a guiding star for your creative discussions throughout\nsession zero and beyond.\nFor example, you might pitch one of the following concepts:\n→ Childhood friends reunite at the funeral of their village\nelder and uncover a secret that could destroy the\nworld…or save it.\n→ A science-fantasy romp across the realms with a party\nof misfits who try to find their origins but end up\nfinding a family in one another.\n→ In a world wracked by powerful disasters, a group of\ntreasure hunters is hired to retrieve five lost elemental\nshards to restore the balance of nature.\nYou can also choose a campaign frame from chapter 5 or use\nthose options as inspiration to create your own to share with\nthe group. Alternatively, you can use the campaign frames as\na guide to create a new frame together.\nYou might not know the campaign’s concept at the beginning,\nand that’s okay. Feel free to return to this conversation at the\nend of session zero or throughout the first couple sessions of\nplay as necessary.\nAIM\nAim is what you want from and for your campaign—your\ncreative and social goals. Do you have a specific creative\nagenda? Or do you mostly want to spend a few hours with\nfriends every week making things up together and blowing\noff steam?\nFor example, an aim might center on one of the following:\n→ We’re going to play a weekly campaign from level 1 to\n10 with strong individual and group character arcs.\n→ Our aim is mostly to hang out and chat while killing\nmonsters and getting new powers and cool items.\n→ We want to tell a story that explores the relationship\nbetween grief and community through an action-\nfantasy game in a world recovering from a near-\napocalypse.\nOther ways to explore your game’s aim might be to reference\ntouchstones or character archetypes you want to play,\ndrawing from books, films, comics, music, and other media.\nYou might create a mood board to help define the aesthetic of\nyour campaign or a soundtrack to form an aural soundscape\nfor the vibe you want.\n169\tChapter 3: Session Zero and Safety Tools\n\n-- 170 of 415 --\n\nTONE\nWhile playing Daggerheart, you and your group will build a\nworld entirely your own. Even if you’re using an established\nsetting, your version of that setting will become distinct\nthrough your collective creativity. An important element of\ndefining your world and campaign is agreeing on tone—\nthe emotional landscape and tendency of the campaign.\nEstablishing your game’s tone helps align the players’\nexpectations and ensures everyone has a good time.\nA quick way to pick a tone is to list the following options on\na piece of paper or note card, then circle a few everyone is\nexcited to focus on and cross out tones the players want\nto avoid.\nA D V E N T U R O U S , C O Z Y , D R A M AT I C ,\nF U N N Y , G O O F Y , G R I T T Y , I N T I M AT E ,\nL I G H T H E A R T E D , P O L I T I C A L ,\nR O M A N T I C , S C A R Y , W H I M S I C A L\nExample: Emerson, Kate, Chen, and Asa are starting a new\nDaggerheart campaign. Chen nominates Dramatic to be\nhighlighted and everyone agrees, so that option is circled to\nsignal that it will be prominent in the campaign. Emerson\nsays they’re not interested in a Goofy tone, and nominates\nit to be crossed out. Kate is possibly interested in Goofy,\nbut since Emerson’s not, Kate is willing to cross it out—\nbut in exchange, she asks that the group consider circling\nRomantic.\nChen isn’t interested in Romantic being a central tone, but\ndoesn’t want to cross it out and completely remove it from\nplay. Asa chimes in and nominates Adventurous for a major\ntone, and after discussion, it gets circled. The group agrees\nthat they don’t want a Gritty game, so it gets crossed out.\nThey also cross out Whimsical.\nThis leaves the group with the following list:\nA D V E N T U R O U S , C O Z Y , D R A M AT I C ,\nF U N N Y , G O O F Y , G R I T T Y , I N T I M AT E ,\nL I G H T H E A R T E D , P O L I T I C A L ,\nR O M A N T I C , S C A R Y , W H I M S I C A L\nIn other words, they’re interested in a game that will be\nespecially Adventurous and Dramatic; sometimes Cozy,\nFunny, Intimate, Lighthearted, Political, Romantic, and Scary;\nbut not Goofy, Gritty, or Whimsical.\nSUBJECT\nDiscuss subjects you and the players actively want in the\ngame and topics you want to avoid. Subjects to avoid can\nbe broad themes, such as bigotry and torture, or specific\nelements, such as spiders or a particular name that carries\nemotional weight for a player.\nWhen discussing challenging subjects, it’s important to center\nthe needs and desires of players from marginalized groups\nwho are personally affected by the issues and subject matter\nthat could come up in a given storyline. In heroic fantasy\ngames, some players find it empowering to face oppressive\nforces as part of the evils of the world—allowing those evils\nto be directly fought and overcome—but that should be a\nchoice actively made by the players who are impacted by that\noppression outside the game. Many marginalized people play\nTTRPGs to escape the everyday frustrations and pains of\nbigotry they experience in their daily lives, and they shouldn’t\nbe forced to struggle with them in a game. These choices\nshould be made prioritizing the needs of those most impacted\nby the subject matter. For instance, if your group includes\nLGBTQ players, prioritize their preferences on whether to\ninclude or exclude homophobia, transphobia, and other forms\nof oppression against queer people.\nThis is a good time to pick any specific safety tools you want\nto use during the campaign. We recommend the following\nto start:\nLINES AND VEILS\n“Lines and Veils” are a safety tool designed to be first\nemployed in a session zero and revisited as needed\nthroughout a campaign. When discussing the tones and goals\nfor the game, the GM (or another player) should make a list of\neveryone’s lines and veils. Lines are topics that players do not\nwant in the game. They should not appear in any form. Veils\nare topics that players do not want to feature in the game,\nbut can still exist in the world. Treat lines and veils like a living\ndocument—the list can be updated by anyone at any point.\nX-CARD\nThe X-Card is a tool that allows any player (including the GM)\nto remove content from the game. This traditionally appears\nin the form of a physical card, marked with a large letter X,\nthat is placed within reach of all players at the table. That said,\na table can represent the X-Card through a different item,\ncreating an X with their arms, or using another agreed-upon\nsignal.\nTo utilize the X-Card, a player only needs to tap the card (or\nuse the agreed-upon signal) and note the moment of play they\nwish to “rewind” to. It can help if the player notes the detail\nthey’re flagging for removal, but this is not a requirement for\nusing the tool. The group will simply go back to the designated\nmoment and play forward, making a new choice.\nFor more information about all of these tools, visit\nwww.daggerheart.com/sessionzero.\n170 \tChapter 3: Session Zero and Safety Tools\n\n-- 171 of 415 --\n\nASKING QUESTIONS\nDuring the session zero discussions, some GMs will find\nit useful to ask clarifying questions and dig deeper into\nsuggestions and ideas. Regardless of whether you want to\nuse an existing setting or build your own, one of the best\nways to ensure that players are invested and excited to play\nis to encourage them to bring their ideas and interests to the\nplanning stages in session zero.\nFor example, you might ask questions like the following during\nyour session zero conversation:\n• “Can you talk more about what you mean by wanting to\nmake a post-fantasy world?”\n• “When you said it’d be cool if elven clans worked like a\nbeehive, did you mean physiology, or is this more about\ncommunication and hierarchy?”\n• “What aspect of that fantasy series you mentioned are you\nmost excited to bring into the game? The plot, the setting,\nthe vibes, or something else?”\nFostering an atmosphere of curiosity is also useful for\ninterrogating your own assumptions in worldbuilding. Rather\nthan treating typical fantasy conventions as the default,\nyou can make conscious decisions about your world to\nintentionally build a setting that best fits the fiction your table\nwants to create. For example, your group might consider\nquestions like:\n• “Should all the major countries in our region be\nmonarchies, or do we want them to have different forms\nof government? If they’re monarchies, are they feudal,\nbureaucratic, or a different structure entirely?”\n• “How do people think about gender in this world? Do\nconceptions of gender vary by community, by region, or\nsomething else?”\n• “What, if anything, do we want to change in the existing\nsetting we’re using to better fit the story we’re telling?”\nEvery group is different and every GM’s style is their own, so\nuse the parts of collaborative\nworldbuilding that excite you,\nand feel free to leave behind\nthe aspects that don’t.\nFINDING CAMPAIGN INSPIRATION\nDuring session zero, look for hooks and nuggets of ideas to\nuse as creative inspiration throughout the campaign. This\ncan be things as small as a turn of phrase or the name of a\ncreature or things as big as a player describing a climactic\nscene they want for their character at the end of the\ncampaign.\nYou’ll especially want to note what the players give as their\nanswers for the background and connections prompts while\ncreating their characters. Those answers will form the bulk\nof the initial material for you to use to tie the story of the\ncampaign to the characters, especially if you want that story\nto emerge from those characters’ worlds and lives.\nYou might also choose to frame your questions with additional\nnarrative you think is interesting. If you do, leave space for\nthat player to push back on your additions to their answers\nand discuss as needed:\n• “Jasper, how did you get the Crystal of the Sunbearer? And\nwhat does it whisper to you at night before you drift off to\nsleep?”\n• “The simiah mentioned that his sister settled in a small\ntown. Sprout, what do you think about having that sister\nbe from the town you accidentally destroyed?”\nKeep your GM principles in mind throughout this process—\nthese apply to all stages of the campaign, not just in-scene\nplay.\n171\tChapter 3: Session Zero and Safety Tools\n\n-- 172 of 415 --\n\nEXAMPLE SESSION ZERO\nBREAKDOWN\nAssuming a 4-hour time slot for session zero, here’s an\nexample of how you might structure it.\nBEFOREHAND\nAhead of the session, you’ll want to prepare materials for the\ngame. This process often differs if you’re playing in person or\nover a virtual tabletop; for a physical table, you might want to\nprint off documents, but the digital files used during an online\ngame could also be utilized through laptops or tablets.\nGather—or have players open digital versions of—character\nsheets, reference sheets, play guides, maps, notetaking tools,\nphysical dice or online dice rollers, and any other play aids\nyou think you’ll need. Before the players arrive, prepare the\nphysical or VTT play space and make it as comfortable for\nyourself and the players as you can.\nPLAYER INTRODUCTIONS (5–10 MIN)\nIf you haven’t all played together before, facilitate\nintroductions as the players arrive and make sure everyone\nknows what pronouns to use for one another. If all the players\nalready know one another, you can spend this time catching\nup and settling in.\nSESSION OVERVIEW (5–10 MIN)\nExplain to the players what will be involved in this session\nzero. Point out the materials and explain when they’ll want\nto use them. Many people find it helpful to browse through\nmaterials before using them, but encourage people not to get\ntoo far ahead of the discussion.\nCATS (40 MIN)\nDiscuss what the group wants from the game using CATS or\nanother framework. This includes what the campaign should\nbe about, what you want from the campaign socially and\ncreatively, logistical details (like how often, when, and where\nyou’re going to play), the tone of the game, content to include\nand exclude, and anything else you need to cover before\ndeciding the setting and making characters.\nBREAK (5–10 MIN)\nIt’s good to take breaks to let everyone move around, refresh\nthemselves, and get a little bit of time to decompress from\ncreative discussions, which can demand a lot of attention\nand energy.\nWORLDBUILDING (50 MIN)\nWhether you’re using the guidance in the upcoming “Running\na Campaign” section, a campaign frame from chapter 5, or\nyour own worldbuilding tools, facilitate the process of creating\nor fleshing out the setting for your campaign. During the\nprocess, think about the elements (tropes, genres, influences)\nthe players are especially interested in, then do what you can\nto build those elements into the setting. Worldbuilding can be\nengrossing, but you don’t need to define or name every part of\nthe map at this stage. Leave yourself blank spaces to fill in later\nas you continue to build the setting together through play.\nAlternatively, you may instead want to introduce players to a\nsetting you’ve created! Use this time to introduce your setting\nand answer any questions they may have.\nBREAK (5–10 MIN)\nSince character creation is such an important part of\npreparing a campaign, it’s good to go in fresh. Consider taking\nanother short break between worldbuilding and the next step.\nCHARACTER CREATION (70 MIN)\nWalk the group through character creation using the\n“Character Creation” section of chapter 1 and the “Character\nCreation” PDF guide, helping players with their questions and\nfacilitating discussion and coordination between players. This\nstep may also include explaining some of the game’s rules so\nplayers understand the abilities from class, subclass, heritage,\nand domain cards.\nPay special attention to the group’s discussion of each\ncharacter’s background and connections, as they will play a\nvital role in your preparations for the campaign. This is a great\nplace to ask questions and encourage players to flesh out their\nanswers. If time is limited or this process is taking longer than\nexpected, try to at least complete the background questions\nand make one connection per player.\nBREAK (5 MIN)\nIf you’ve got time left in your session, you can take a short\nbreak before doing wrap-up and feedback, or a longer break if\nyou’ve got the time for a bit more play before finishing for the\nday.\nINTRODUCTORY SCENE (OPTIONAL; 30 MIN)\nIf you have the time, you can throw the characters into an\ninitial scene to help the players get a handle on the rules and\ntheir characters. This scene can be non-canon or serve as a\njump start for the campaign. You can start with something\ncalmer, such as a slice-of-life scene, or immediately throw the\ncharacters into a dramatic opening.\nWRAP-UP AND FEEDBACK (10 MIN)\nUse the last few minutes of the session to check in with the\nplayers—gather their feedback about the session zero, see\nif they have any additional questions, and ask if they want to\nrevisit any safety tools or content concerns.\n172 \tChapter 3: Session Zero and Safety Tools\n\n-- 173 of 415 --\n\nRunning a Session\nThis section provides guidance for preparing and running a session of Daggerheart.\nIf you’d like to start with a single-session adventure, the\nupcoming “Running a One-Shot” section can provide\ninspiration for your adventure’s setting and story.\nWhen you’re ready to dive into a longer campaign, see the\n“Running a Campaign” section on page 185.\nTHINKING IN BEATS\nIn storytelling, a beat is a moment that changes the trajectory\nof the narrative—a shift in the world, a significant action or\nreaction, an emotional revelation, or an important decision.\nAs the GM in a collaborative game, you’re going to take turns\nwith the players, narrating a beat and then letting them react\nand carry the scene forward with their own beats. It’s like a\ndance, a conversation, or a game of tennis.\nThis focus on beats is very useful for preparation—rather\nthan writing out every single detail of what’s going to happen,\nyou can think in beats, the moments that give shape to the\nscene or sequence.\nThe following is an example of thinking in beats to create a\ncountdown. The GM is preparing a session where a mercenary\ncompany seizes control of a border town in a narrow mountain\npass. The mercenaries are loyal to an invading army and this\nlocation will be an important step in their invasion.\nEXAMPLE BEATS AS A COUNTDOWN TO INVASION\n8 The mercenary company makes a partnership with the\nneighboring kingdom.\n7 One of the mercenaries arrives in town and gets a job\nwith the city guard.\n6 The undercover mercenary is assigned to night duty, as\nexpected for new hires in the guard.\n5 The undercover mercenary ambushes the other night\nguards and unlocks the town gate.\n4 The mercenaries rush through the open gate and attack\nthe guard barracks and the mayor’s house.\n3 The mercenaries kill or subdue the city guard and\ncapture the mayor.\n2 Under threat of violence to the townspeople, the mayor\npledges loyalty to the invading warlord.\n1 The warlord’s forces arrive to resupply as the\nmercenaries hold the town to protect the invaders’\nsupply lines.\n0 The invasion begins.\nIf the PCs are in the town, they can interrupt this sequence of\nevents at any point. They might see the disguised mercenary\nattacking his fellows, or they might be in the tavern when\nthe mercenaries stream down the main road, headed for the\nbarracks and mayor’s house.\nKnowing the major beats of the mercenaries’ plan makes it\neasier to maintain the integrity of the fiction while the PCs are\nacting. The PCs might stop the attack on the barracks but not\nthe seizure of the mayor. This could lead to the mercenaries\nfortifying the mayor’s house with him as a hostage while the\nmembers of the town guard ask the PCs for assistance.\nThinking in beats is also useful for larger-scale planning\nand off-screen thinking. If the party is racing toward a city\nto prevent a coup, you can use a progress countdown to\ntrack their distance from the city and a standard countdown\nto represent the steps of that coup. Keep the pace of both\ncountdowns in mind when setting the frequency of events.\nIf the PCs need to travel five hundred miles (represented by\nthe progress countdown), then the coup could take place\nover a week (represented by the standard countdown), with a\ncountdown step occurring each day. As the PCs make action\nrolls to determine how far they can travel in a day, you can\nresolve the advancement of the Progress Countdown, then\ntick down the standard countdown by 1. Should the PCs need\nto travel a shorter distance, you can similarly shrink the time\nframe the coup takes place over, such as from a week to a\nfew days, with each countdown step occurring every few\nhours. This format lets you know what’s happening as the PCs\nburst onto the scene, rather than having to improvise in the\nmoment.\nEXAMPLE COUNTDOWN STEPS TO COUP\n6 A band of assassins sneaks into the capital city.\n5 The assassins infiltrate the homes of the prime minister\nand other leaders of the majority party.\n4 The assassins kill the prime minister and other party\nleaders. Meanwhile, a fifth “assassin” stages a fake\nattempt on the minority party leader to throw off\nsuspicion. The minority party leader is, in fact, the\nmastermind behind this whole plot.\n3 The minority party leader parades the “assassin”\nthrough the streets and pledges justice for his fellow\nministers.\n2 With the majority party leaderless, the minority party\ntakes power in the legislative council and the captured\nassassin is replaced by a nameless prisoner before being\nexecuted.\n1 Under the guise of “security,” the new prime minister\npushes a slate of legislation to increase executive power\nand ensure he retains power.\n0 The prime minister is now a de facto emperor.\n173\tChapter 3: Running a Session\n\n-- 174 of 415 --\n\nPREPARING COMBAT\nENCOUNTERS\nIn Daggerheart, it’s important to approach each encounter\nfrom the perspective of “What helps tell the story?” and build\nthe hurdles the PCs face around that question. Through this\nlens, we can start to think about enemies and damage as more\nthan collections of mechanics and stat blocks—they’re tools\nin our GM toolbox for heightening tension and creating drama.\nAs you start GMing Daggerheart, balancing encounters and\ncreating appropriate enemies for your players will often take\nguesswork during prep. However, the more sessions you run,\nthe easier it will become. Adjust on the fly as necessary to find\nthe right balance as you play, and you’ll naturally figure out\nwhat works best for your table. The most important element\nis to ensure that combat is being used to give players more\ninformation about the unfolding story—it reveals more about\nthe world, the plot, or the characters.\nThis section includes general advice for prepping encounters\nthat will, hopefully, make your life easier. These tips are\nmeant to help with creating narratively-grounded encounters\nand planning how to best challenge your party based on their\ncurrent capabilities and circumstances. Where it comes to\nprepping encounters mechanically, chapter 4 has several\nsections to help, such as “Choosing Adversaries,” “Improvising\nAdversaries,” and “Using Environments.” Use the following\nguidelines as a jumping-off place, finetune the details with\nchapter 4, then tweak combat as needed while you home\nin on what works best for your group, both narratively\nand mechanically.\nBATTLES AND NARRATIVE\nBattles play an important part in high fantasy adventure\nstories. Many challenges can be answered through cunning\nand charm, but battle often serves as the primary vehicle\nthrough which obstacles are addressed. Dynamic battles\ncreate suspense—forcing players to choose between their\nvarious objectives, engaging their character’s motivations and\nweaknesses, and creating the crucible that the players use to\nforge their characters into legendary heroes.\nThe following prompts guide you through building the story\naround the battles, ensuring each clash of swords feels\npoignant in the greater tale.\nNarrative Function\nThe first thing to consider when building a battle in\nDaggerheart is the narrative function the battle is playing.\nIs this battle an obstacle along the way to a larger objective,\ndesigned to show the breadth of a villain’s influence? Is an\nambush the result of failed rolls to notice that the party\nis being tailed? Is this fight the culmination of an arc for a\ncharacter as they confront a figure from their background?\nWhatever the answer, that narrative role should stay with you\nthroughout the process of building and running a battle.\nAdversary Motives\nThe next thing to think about is motive. What are the motives\nof the adversaries arrayed against the party? What would it\ntake for the adversary to surrender? To flee? What objective\ndoes the adversary have beyond survival? If given the choice\nbetween capturing the artifact the PCs have with them and\ndelivering the final blow to a character, which way would the\nadversary act? Keeping these questions in mind can help you\nmake quick decisions about what actions an adversary will\ntake in combat.\nDynamic Environment\nBattles become more memorable when you include\ncompelling adversaries and dynamic environments the players\n(and the PCs) can interact with in interesting ways. If the\nenemies are on their own territory, think about how they’d\nmanipulate their environment to stack the deck in their favor.\nHave they built fortifications on the high ground? Have they\nblocked off alternate routes to force attackers into a frontal\nassault with exposed flanks? How can the battlefield and\nterrain reinforce the narrative goal of the battle and show the\nadversaries’ motives? Chapter 4 presents environment stat\nblocks you can use to further bring your battleground to life.\nFLIGHT AND OTHER FEATURES\nWhen building battles, consider the abilities and spells\nyour PCs have. For example, if they can fly, consider adding\nenemies that can fly or attack distant targets, ensuring\nthe combat remains dynamic and challenging for all PCs.\nRemember that your players probably chose their features\nbecause they want to use them! You have the chance to craft\nengaging opportunities for the players to show off those\npowers in exciting ways.\n174 \tChapter 3: Running a Session\n\n-- 175 of 415 --\n\nEXAMPLE BATTLE NARRATIVE\nThis example demonstrates how you might plan a battle that implements the previous narrative considerations.\nSetup\nEarly in a campaign, the party is going to travel to a forest\nknown to have especially strong nature spirits protecting\nit. The party includes Sprout Hilldweller, a Warden of the\nElements druid who is being hunted by a corrupted Greater\nEarth Elemental. The party also has a ranger, Marigold Seok,\nwho would be interested in any disruptions to the natural\nworld and is eager to face the corrupted elemental.\nThe GM, Ben, decides to start the arc with a bang by\nhaving the party attacked by Dryads and other nature spirit\nadversaries as they enter the woods.\nNarrative Function\nThe fight is meant to communicate to the party that the\ncorrupted earth elemental’s influence has already infected\nthe nature spirits of these woods. It also introduces the\nenemy types that will play a major role in this arc, helping the\ncharacters and players learn their powers and weaknesses.\nLastly, it provides an opportunity for the druid and ranger\nto showcase their Experiences, Sage domain cards, class\nfeatures, and community features that will provide them\nwith specialized knowledge and relevant abilities for the fight.\nAdversary Motives\nBen decides that the corrupted Earth Elemental wants to\nsever all connections between mortals and nature so that\nnature can return to a primordial state of unchecked growth.\nThe elemental corrupted the dryads and other forest spirits\nhave been warped by capitalizing on their resentment of\noutsiders and stoking their fears about the forest being\ndestroyed. Now the elemental can possess them at will\nwithout their knowledge or memory.\nThe fight will take place in a former druid grove using\nthe Abandoned Grove environment, the site of a bloody\nconfrontation where the possessed dryads and other nature\nspirits killed most of the druids and drove out the others.\nComplicating the situation is the fact that the dryads don’t\nremember being possessed, only a violent conflict with\nthe druids over a poorly remembered disagreement. Any\nsubstantial conversation with the dryads in the grove exposes\nthat foggy memory and provides a thread to pull on. Ben plans\nto have the elemental assume direct control and attack the\nparty after just a couple of beats of interaction, using a\nhidden countdown.\nWhen the fight starts, Ben plans to hint at the manipulation by\ndescribing the dryads and treants moving as if they were being\ncontrolled, with the Dryads weeping as they pull down trees\nto attack the party. This complicates the apparent motives of\nthe adversaries and should prime the PCs to look beyond first\nappearances to find out what’s going on.\nDynamic Environment\nBen plans to let the PCs arrive alone in the Abandoned Grove\nso he can use the environment’s “Overgrown Battlefield”\nfeature to encourage them to investigate and begin piecing\ntogether clues. After that, the dryad and their forces can arrive\nto confront the PCs. The PCs will likely explain themselves,\nexposing the weirdness around the dryads’ memories. Ben\nalso makes a note to describe some oddities about the woods\nand dryads, signaling to the PCs that something is wrong.\nNext, Ben draws inspiration from the Burning Heart of the\nWood environment (see the “Environment Stat Blocks” section\non page 242). He utilizes its “Grasping Vines” and “Chaos\nMagic Locus” features and adapts them to Tier 2. This can\nmake the scene more perilous and memorable—the vines can\nRestrain the PCs to escalate the stakes in a social or combat\nscene, and the “Chaos Magic Locus” feature further signals to\nthe PCs that something is magically wrong with these woods.\nAlternatively, Ben could decide to skip the “Chaos Magic\nLocus” feature and develop another passive feature of his\nown. Maybe a certain species of animal is following the party\nand can be befriended for more information, or a pack of\ndangerous creatures will find them if they rest for too long\nbefore reaching the grove.\n175\tChapter 3: Running a Session\n\n-- 176 of 415 --\n\nSESSION REWARDS\nThe most common reward given out to players and their\ncharacters during a session of Daggerheart is information.\nThe location of a bandit’s hideout, the magical ritual needed\nto break a curse, or the weakness of a powerful monster—\nthis steady stream of information helps the players decide\nwhere to go and what to do. Information keeps the story\nmoving by answering questions, introducing new questions,\nor complicating the party’s understanding of something they\nthought they knew.\nOn a slightly longer time frame—every few sessions, at the\nend of an arc, or at special moments when it makes sense in\nthe fiction—loot can be an exciting reward. For example, PCs\nmight find gear in a mercenary company’s supply wagon after\na few sessions of searching for missing mercenaries.\nCharacters should get access to weapons and armor of their\ntier, usually within the first few levels of entering a new tier\nto keep pace with adversaries. Some players love getting\nnew weapons and armor, while others may have established\nan emotional connection to an item (for example, a family\nheirloom sword or armor once worn by an old friend) and want\nto keep it. If PCs want to keep their current weapon or armor,\nconsider other ways they could be enhanced. A clever witch\ncould impart enchantments on a breastplate to make it more\ndurable, a blacksmith could upgrade arrow tips to deal more\ndamage, or a god could bless a sword with a deadly edge. You\ncan employ a variety of narrative beats to improve or refurbish\nthe PCs’ equipment, upgrading it to the appropriate tier.\nCRAFTING SCENES\nOne of your main responsibilities as a GM in Daggerheart is to\nset the scene for your players. Whenever you start a session,\narrive at a new place, or change the situation, the players are\ngoing to look to you for what they need to know. When you do\nthis, think with all of your senses—not just what this place\nlooks like, but what does it smell, feel, taste, and sound like?\nWhat is something unique or unexpected about this place, and\nwhat does that say about it? Your players will use these details\nto interact with the world, so give them enough to not only\npicture the scene, but make choices about what they do and\nwhere they go.\nExample: “You step into the mouth of the cave and for a\nlong moment you’re in pitch darkness. You can hear the soft\ntap, tap, tap of water in the distance suggesting there may\nbe an underground river ahead. The stone is slick beneath\nyour feet, as you gingerly step forward. At first, there’s only\nthe dank smell you expect from a cave: the earthy tang of\nlichen on mold. But then there’s a gust of wind forced from\ndeep within the cavern, and you’re overcome by the sickly\nsweet smell of rotting meat. Something died here recently…\nAs you move deeper inside, you begin to make out sharp\nwhite stalactites bearing down on you…. No—these aren’t\nformations of stone. They’re teeth! You aren’t standing on\nslick stone; you’re balanced on the salivating tongue of a\ngreat beast. You feel that fetid wash of air come over you\nagain—the creature is taking a deep breath and preparing\nto swallow. What do you want to do?”\nSHARING THE SPOTLIGHT\nIt’s rare that every PC will organically have the same amount\nof spotlight time during a given session. In any group, some\nplayers are more outgoing than others—and some PCs are\ninstigators, while others are more cautious. As the GM, you\ncan help ensure that the story’s focus rotates between the\nPCs, so each player has ample time in the spotlight.\nTIE TOGETHER STORY ELEMENTS\nIf you know that a specific PC is going to be in the spotlight\nfor a session or an arc, you can try to involve the other PC by\ndrawing on their ties to the spotlit PC and by including story\nelements that will excite them. For example, if the courtier\nbard is invited to a debutante ball that ties into his backstory,\nyou might decide that the ball will also be hosting a fencing\ntournament (which you hope will excite the swashbuckler\nrogue) and social dancing (which should interest the noble-\nborn sorcerer). You’re confident that the warrior will be excited\nabout the scene already, as he has sworn to protect the bard\nand is not-so-secretly in love with him.\nENGAGE QUIET PLAYERS\nYou can also engage a quieter player by directly inviting action\nfrom their character, rather than broadly asking the whole\nparty what they’re doing next. Alternatively, you could ask how\ntheir character feels about unfolding events.\nUSE VISUAL AIDS\nAnother approach to balancing play is to use visual aids. For\nexample, you can draw out a space for each character on\na sheet of paper to make an action tracker. When a player\ntakes an action, they place one token on the tracker in their\ncharacter’s space. Throughout a session, a quick look at the\ntracker will show you which players are taking more actions\nand help you remember to engage the players that haven’t\nacted as much. This visual reminder can also help the other\nplayers know who could use an invitation into the spotlight.\nENCOURAGE UNGUIDED PLAY\nSometimes you might realize your NPCs and the wider scene\nhave received a lot of focus. As the GM, you too can share the\nspotlight by creating opportunities to let the players or their\ncharacters speak among themselves. The players can carry\nout a downtime scene or interpersonal moment without your\ninput while you listen and observe—and take note of story\nthreads to weave into later scenes.\n176 \tChapter 3: Running a Session\n\n-- 177 of 415 --\n\nUSING CONFLICT\nDaggerheart is a game of perilous adventure, where conflict\nplays a key role in creating drama and provoking strong\ncharacter choices.\nConflict in Daggerheart results when the characters’ hopes\nand actions are met by opposition and uncertainty. If the\ngroup’s wizard seeks to become the world’s greatest\nspellcaster, her quest likely won’t be as satisfying if she’s\nnever challenged along the way.\nConflicts can be external (outside forces act against a\ncharacter) or internal (a character struggles against themself\nemotionally or intellectually). Our wizard might face external\nconflict: tests of skill against other mages, magical puzzles\nthat appraise her knowledge and cunning, and eventually trials\nagainst legendary beings who wield the most potent magic\nin the world. Meanwhile, her internal conflicts might include\nstruggling with the ideologies taught to her in school, or even\nfearing the destructive power of her own magic.\nThe strongest character arcs in Daggerheart emerge from\na combination of internal and external conflicts. External\nconflicts can bring up unresolved tensions from internal\nconflicts, while resolving internal conflicts can provide clarity\nfor a character that allows them to overcome external conflict.\nWhen designing conflicts for maximum emotional impact,\nchallenge characters in a way that ties in their internal\nstruggles. If a character struggles with self-confidence,\nchallenge them to excel. If a character struggles with the\nethics of using power, put them in situations where using their\npower has high stakes for other people, not just themselves.\nConflicts like these push the characters to better themselves,\nforging them decision by decision until they emerge as\nunforgettable heroes.\n177\tChapter 3: Running a Session\n\n-- 178 of 415 --\n\nSOCIAL CONFLICT\nBattles and armed conflict are common in games of\nDaggerheart, but your characters may also trade barbs with\ncourtiers, talk their way past guards, seduce rivals, and plead\ntheir innocence to an uncaring monarch. Always keep motive\nin mind, considering how the characters’ request or demand\naligns or conflicts with the NPCs’ aims.\nWhen NPCs or creatures aren’t hostile but aren’t inclined to\ndo as the party asks, it helps to think about the scene less\nas a conflict and more as a collaborative process where both\nparties are trying to get what they want while maintaining or\nimproving their existing relationship.\nInfluencing NPCs\nFor everyday social obstacles, a single successful action may\nbe sufficient to progress, such as haggling down a merchant\nor convincing a steward to let you into a noble’s estate. On a\nsuccess with Fear, you can introduce a minor setback—for\nexample, an NPC might demand a bribe or set other special\nterms before they’ll do what the character asks.\nWhen dealing with more formidable NPCs, a single action\nmight not be enough to change their mind. A hostile\ncountess couldn’t be convinced to send troops to help fight\na necromancer with a single roll. Since an adversary or PC\nbecomes Vulnerable while their Stress slots are full, you can\nuse an adversary’s Stress slots as the meter for tracking an\nextended or higher-stakes social conflict. By default, one\nsuccessful social action against an adversary (intimidation,\ndeceit, bribery, etc.) forces them to mark a Stress. Some\nabilities (such as class or domain abilities) also force\nadversaries to mark Stress—these are highly useful in social\nconflicts so long as they’re narratively applicable. (Using\nan ability that forces an adversary to mark Stress upon a\nsuccessful attack may be ill-advised in a noble’s court).\nExample: A Petty Noble has a distaste for the party. The\nPetty Noble has 4 Stress, so if the PCs want to get back into\nthe noble’s good graces or force them to concede a point,\nthe GM could tell the party that if they fill the noble’s Stress\ntrack, they’ll change the noble’s mind.\nCountdowns in Social Conflict\nIf a social situation has especially high stakes, you might\nset a consequence countdown or a time limit to represent\nthe adversary’s patience. The PCs take actions to mark the\nadversary’s Stress, while trying to minimize consequences\nthat tick down the countdown. If this high-stakes countdown\ntriggers, the PCs lose the opportunity—or suffer a\nconsequence, such as being kicked from a gala or having the\nguards called on them.\nEXAMPLE SOCIAL CONFLICT\nThe party is making an appeal to a Petty Noble to send\ntroops to deal with a growing undead threat in the woods.\nThe noble is disinclined to help, even if they did believe\nthat the undead threat was real. Ben tells the party that\nthe noble has 5 Stress, and if they can force the noble to\nmark the whole track, they’ll convince the noble to dispatch\ntroops to investigate.\nThe party’s wizard Barnabas goes first, producing the\nstill-twitching tibia taken from a skeleton in the swamp.\nHe describes the magical power needed to maintain a\nnecromantic effect when a corpse is rendered into such\nsmall pieces. Ben calls that a Presence Roll, but Asa asks to\nroll for Barnabas with Knowledge, focusing on the arcane\ndisplay and demonstration of intellect. Ben says that he\nwould normally give disadvantage on a Knowledge Roll\nhere, since Presence is usually better for persuasion, but\nthat the evidence would give advantage on that roll.\nWith advantage and disadvantage canceling out, Barnabas\nrolls a success with Hope, and Ben marks a Stress on the\nnoble. Since Barnabas rolled a success with Hope, Ben\ninvites the players to continue.\nNext, Jasper the bard takes the stage, recalling the story\nof when the party entered the swamp and first battled\nthe undead raised by this necromantic force. Jasper uses\ntheir Enrapture spell and makes a Presence Roll, getting\na success with Fear. Jasper’s player, Emerson, chooses to\nmark Stress to force the noble to mark a Stress, bringing\nthem down to 2 Stress remaining. Ben gains a Fear and\nmakes a move, describing how they can hear a carriage\narriving outside, and it won’t be long until they aren’t\nalone anymore.\nSince Jasper has the Petty Noble Enraptured, Ben asks\nEmerson whether they want to continue. Emerson says\nthey’ll weave the words of any party member that speaks\ninto the spell if that’s okay. Ben agrees, wanting to involve\nthe whole party.\nNext, the group’s ranger Marigold takes the economic\nangle, telling the noble that if they don’t act, the noble’s\nsubjects will die and therefore be unable to work and pay\ntaxes. Kate makes a Presence Roll for Marigold and critically\nsucceeds! Since a normal social action would mark a Stress,\nBen decides that he’ll mark 2 Stress instead on a critical\nsuccess, which includes the noble’s last Stress.\nWith the Petty Noble’s Stress exhausted, Ben describes how\nthey finally agree to dispatch a patrol.\n178 \tChapter 3: Running a Session\n\n-- 179 of 415 --\n\nARMED CONFLICT\nChapter 4 presents rules for using adversary and environment\nstat blocks in combat—but as you plan for combat, remember\nthat the most resonant battle scenes aren’t about violence,\nthey’re about people and motivation. Violence conveys\nunderlying emotions, developing NPCs and the wider world\nthey inhabit. When bandits raid a village, they’re not just\nlooking to hurt others—their motive might be greed or\ndesperation, but either way, violence is their means to an end.\nThe following sections give guidance for creating emotionally\nresonant combat scenes.\nLayering Goals into Combat\nThe drama of a battle should stem from narrative goals, rather\nthan solely from the risk the PCs will die. Daggerheart isn’t\na particularly deadly game, and the players likely know that.\nThe PCs typically fight for a reason, such as defending loved\nones or subverting a villain’s schemes—if their battle relates\nto multiple goals or narrative threads, this adds uncertainty to\nthe outcomes and increases dramatic tension.\nYou can do this by ensuring that the adversary’s motivation\nis front and center and introducing an objective that goes\nbeyond “kill or knock out the opponents.” If you establish\na special objective for the adversaries (or PCs) before the\nconflict begins, the scene suddenly has more dimensions\nand characters have immediate options for actions to take\nbeyond just trading attacks. Another way of thinking about\naction scenes is to consider the defining action verb. Is this\nscene just about fighting the enemy or is the party securing\na position so that the wizard can conduct the ritual by the\nsolstice? The follow example illustrates a combat with three\nobjectives:\nExample: After the blood mage Caressa kidnapped the\ngovernor’s husband Osten, the PCs tracked her across the\nShattered Mountains. When they confront her in the Ruins\nof Nix, she’s conducting a ritual to seize Osten’s latent\nmagical power. The PCs want to stop the ritual, save Osten,\nand capture Caressa. But which of those goals is most\nimportant? If the PCs are winning the fight, what happens\nif you put Osten in danger and make the players choose\nbetween rescuing him and capturing Caressa?\nThe outcome of the previous example is uncertain, entirely\ndependent on the PCs’ choices and luck. They could achieve\na partial victory by capturing Caressa after Osten dies or\nallowing Caressa to get away to save Osten. With cleverness\nand good rolls, they could stop Caressa, capture her, and save\nOsten, accomplishing all their goals. The uncertainty is what\nmakes the combat dynamic and tense.\nWhen in doubt, you can use the following table to randomly\ngenerate an objective to work into a combat or action\nscene. Roll 1d12 or pick an option to use as the goal of the\nadversaries (or the PCs).\nObjective Generation Prompt\n1d12 \tObjective\n1 \tAcquire (obtain or steal) an important item or\nitems.\n2 \tCapture one or more of the opponents.\n3 \tActivate a magical device.\n4 \tFrame a character or tarnish their reputation.\n5 \tDrive the opponent into a corner or ambush point.\n6 \tStop a magical ritual, legal ceremony, or time-\nsensitive spell.\n7 \tHold the line—keep the enemy from reaching a\nspecific area or group.\n8 \tPlant evidence or a tracking device on a target.\n9 \tSecure a specific location ahead of another group’s\narrival.\n10 \tHarass the opponent to deplete their resources or\nkeep them occupied.\n11 \tDestroy a piece of architecture, a statue, a shrine,\nor a weapon.\n12 \tInvestigate a situation to confirm or deny existing\ninformation.\nUsing Fear for Drama\nDuring battles, spend Fear to keep the characters on their\ntoes. Duality Rolls cause momentum to dramatically ebb and\nflow as the PCs fail their rolls or succeed with Fear in the fight.\nWhile a lucky streak of Hope Rolls means you don’t\nautomatically get a GM move, you can still interrupt the\nplayers’ momentum by spending a Fear to make a GM move.\nBecause of this, we recommend keeping a few Fear on\nreserve, especially during battles, so you have the ability to\ninterrupt the scene and create more tension as needed.\nWhen spending Fear, think about what move will most\npowerfully impact the scene. Change the energy or nature\nof the fight by activating a powerful foe’s ability, bringing\nreinforcements into the battle, shifting the environment, or\nhaving the foes move boldly toward their objective.\n179\tChapter 3: Running a Session\n\n-- 180 of 415 --\n\nPhased Battles\nBattles become more memorable when the nature of the\nfoes or the boundaries of the space shift mid-combat. These\nphases of battle create a sense of natural evolution and\nescalation, increasing the dramatic tension. Consider the\nfollowing ways to introduce phases to a combat:\nChange the Terms of Engagement\nTurn a fight into a chase, reveal information that turns\nthe group’s allies against them, or give the party reason to\ntemporarily ally with a faction they’re battling.\nExample: During a pitched battle with an infamous thief,\nyou use a GM move to have the thief steal an important\nartifact from the PCs and attempt to flee. This results in a\nchase, keeping the story dynamic and forcing the players to\nadapt.\nChange the Battlefield\nDuring a battle, use a natural phenomenon, an arcane effect,\nor an adversary’s action to alter the environment. This\nchange can be mechanical, such as a raging blizzard reducing\nvisibility, or aesthetic, such as a powerful wizard dominating\nthe sky with arcane runes while channeling a powerful spell.\nSome battlefield changes repeat themselves—for example,\nan earth dragon might occasionally crash into the walls of\ntheir lair, dropping boulders and changing the shape of the\nbattlefield. This move might occur on a countdown loop.\nOther changes only happen once, in which case you might\ncreate an Environment move triggered by a specific narrative\nor mechanical event. A god’s champion might sunder the\ncoliseum in a divine realm when she marks her last point of\nStress, shattering the floor and dropping the party atop a\npane of otherworldly glass surrounded by the rich colors\nof the cosmos.\nIf you plan this type of move ahead of time, you might prepare\ntwo maps: one for the start of the fight, and another for when\nthe space changes.\nChange the Foes\nVideo games often change their bosses at a certain point in a\nfight, such as when their health is halved or they’re seemingly\ndefeated. Taking a cue from those battles, you can change an\nadversary in behavior, form, or both: A massive, lumbering\nenemy splits into multiple, more agile adversaries who act in\nperfect synchronicity. A defeated foe courses with eldritch\npower that remolds their flesh into an unspeakable form and\ngrants them sinister new powers.\nIn Daggerheart, you can create a phase change for an enemy\nin a few ways. You might give the foe a passive feature that\ntriggers when half of their Hit Points are marked, or you might\nprepare two adversary stat blocks, one for each phase. This\nbook presents several adversaries with the “Phase Change”\nfeature, which you can use as inspiration for creating your own.\nIf you didn’t prepare a phase change but the party is defeating\na major foe more easily than expected, it’s okay to let the PCs\nhave the easy win. However, if that feels anticlimactic, feel\nfree to improvise a phase two. Describe how the adversary\nseems to be defeated, then narrate them standing back up or\nsurging with new energy, clear some of their HP, change some\nof their statistics or base attack, and improvise a new feature\nor two to represent how they’ve changed. An enemy that\nthrows off their armor might lower their damage thresholds\nbut gain Relentless and move about with blistering speed. You\nmight even switch to a different stat block on the fly as the foe\ntransforms into a new and unexpected form.\nWhen an enemy takes a new form, try to draw upon the story\nto explain the second phase. A blood mage holding out a\nbloody hand and channeling a powerful spell to transform into\nan Abomination is both surprising and inevitable. But if the\nplayers never learned that the enemy was a blood mage, that\nreveal won’t be as satisfying. Foreshadow information about\nenemies in advance as much as you can, but if you have to\ncreate connective tissue in the moment, you can treat it as\na reveal as the transforming enemy boasts about not having\ndemonstrated their full power.\n180 \tChapter 3: Running a Session\n\n-- 181 of 415 --\n\nUSING DOWNTIME\nDowntime lets the players recover resources during short and long rests, but it also provides an opportunity to zoom in on the\nrelationships between characters and how they process the intense emotions of their adventures. You can use downtime scenes\nas a pressure release valve to vary the intensity of the story and give the PCs room to breathe.\nEmpower your players to frame their own downtime scenes. Ask the players what it looks like as they tend to their wounds or\nunwind together, encouraging them to take the reins and work with other players whose characters are involved.\nPROJECTS DURING DOWNTIME\nThe Work on a Project downtime move requires more GM\ninput than other downtime moves and is best suited for long-\nterm endeavors the PCs wish to undertake.\nThese projects are typically tracked using a Progress\nCountdown. When deciding the starting value of the\ncountdown, consider the complexity of the project, the\navailability of relevant tools, and the impact of the project\non the story. If completing the project will give the group\nessential information they need to move on, you may want\nto set the starting value at a low number to ensure the group\ndoesn’t have to wait too long for the next clue or story beat. If\nthe project isn’t tightly linked to other parts of the story and\nit simply requires time, you might start the countdown at a\nhigher number.\nSimple projects might tick down the countdown each time\nthe player uses the Work on a Project move. However, if the\nproject is skill dependent, you can ask how the PC makes\nprogress and then call for a roll using a trait that matches\ntheir approach.\nWhen a player rolls to progress their project, it doesn’t feel\ngreat if the roll simply ends in failure. If you use the Dynamic\nCountdown Advancement table in the earlier “Countdowns”\nsection, consider letting a failure give the PC special insight\ninto their goal, which grants them advantage on their next\nroll for that project. Alternatively, you can instead use the\nfollowing criteria so the PC always makes progress even\non a failure:\n• Critical Success: 4 ticks\n• Success with Hope: 3 ticks\n• Success with Fear: 2 ticks\n• Any failure: 1 tick\nGM DOWNTIME\nWhen players use downtime to rest and refresh, you gain Fear\nand can progress a countdown happening in the background:\n• On a short rest, gain 1d4 Fear.\n• On a long rest, gain an amount of Fear equal to the\nnumber of PCs + 1d4 and advance a long-term countdown.\nThis helps make the world feel alive—and it reminds players\nthat the more resting they do, the more the world moves\nwithout them, so they might want to be careful\nhow much they rest.\nEXTENDED DOWNTIME\nIf you’re fast-forwarding the story across multiple days (or\nlonger), you probably don’t need a separate scene for each\nlong rest during that time. During these longer stretches,\nconsider talking to your players about what their characters\nwant to accomplish, then using montages to illustrate the\npassage of time. You gain 1d6 Fear per PC and can advance\nthe long-term countdowns as appropriate for the extended\nperiod of rest.\nSome PC goals might require a single roll (or none at all).\nOthers might call for a series of progress countdown rolls\nto advance a project across several long rests. It’s trivial\nfor a bard to gather rumors during a week-long stay in the\ncity, but you might ask them to make a Presence Roll to see\nwhether they learn some especially important information in\nthe process. Similarly, you could ask your warrior to make a\nFinesse Roll if they’re trying to enhance their armor with rare\nmaterials obtained in their last adventure.\n181\tChapter 3: Running a Session\n\n-- 182 of 415 --\n\nCHARACTER DEATH\nAdjudicating and overseeing the death of a PC may be among the most difficult tasks for a GM. In a game focused on character\nrelationships, personal story arcs, and heroic adventure, the death of a PC should not happen casually. As the GM, you’re\ncharged with honestly portraying the world, and death is more permanent in Daggerheart than in other games of the same\ngenre. Use the following principles to help you navigate these moments fairly and empathetically.\nTip: Adversaries follow different rules for death than PCs; see “Defeated Adversaries” on page 208 for details.\nCHOOSING A DEATH MOVE\nWhen a PC marks their last Hit Point, they must make a death\nmove. Two of the three moves give the player full control over\nwhether their PC lives or dies: with Blaze of Glory, the player is\naccepting the PC’s death, and with Avoid Death, the player is\ndefying the PC’s death. Risk It All comes down to a dice roll—\nthe PC has a nearly even chance of living or dying.\nWhen a player is considering which death move to choose,\nmake space for them to work and talk through their decision.\nYou might give them a moment to think by shifting focus to\nanother PC, or keep focus on the dying PC to let the player\ntake the reins of the story.\nCharacter death is not always satisfying in the moment,\nespecially if the character’s cause of death isn’t directly tied\nto their personal story. But in a heroic fantasy adventure,\ndeath is always a possibility for characters trying to change\nthe world. Death moves give a fatally injured PC a chance for a\nmemorable moment, whether it’s going out in a Blaze of Glory\nor Risking It All on a roll of the dice.\nAvoid Death\nIf a player is certain they aren’t ready to say goodbye to their\nPC, this death move ensures the PC’s survival—though they\nhave a chance of taking a scar and permanently crossing out\none of their Hope slots. If the character only has one Hope slot\nremaining when they make this move and they gain a scar, the\nplayer must retire the character. Even so, that ending may be\npreferable for players who would rather see their character\ngive up the adventuring life than die.\nUsing this move, the PC stays unconscious until healed by an\nally or until the party’s next long rest. Try to give the player\nchances to participate in play if the party isn’t able to heal their\nPC or finish a long rest in short order. You might invite them to\ntemporarily control an NPC in the meantime or, for something\nmore character focused, narrate a scene of their PC on the\nknife’s edge between life and death. On this precipice, they\ncould be visited by the spirit of a departed loved one, receive a\nvision of a disaster they need to avert, or encounter something\nelse that keeps them involved in the story.\nEven without gaining a scar, this move still comes with a cost:\nthe current situation worsens, no matter the PC’s fate. Work\nwith the player to determine how that manifests. The situation\nmight escalate as a new wave of enemies approaches or a\ncountdown ticks down. Alternatively, the PC’s fall might be\nwhat turns the tide of battle in the enemy’s favor—they might\nseize an important item from the heroes or draw power from\nthe character’s suffering.\nRisk It All\nThis is the move that the GM has the least say in. The Duality\nDice decide the character’s fate, and with the exception of\nthe 10th-level Resurrection spell (which can only be used\nonce), that roll is final unless you provide another means of\nresurrection in your story. If the player rolls with Hope, help\nthem decide how to divide the value of the Hope Die between\nHit Points and Stress to clear. You might remind the player\nthat if they choose to clear only a small number of Hit Points,\nthey may be forced to make another death move after just one\nfurther blow.\nThough it is important to reward your player if they roll with\nHope by spotlighting this moment when their PC defies\ndeath, it is just as important to reward your player if they roll\nwith Fear and their character meets their end. Let them have\nsome final words with a friend or a memory that plays as they\nfade from consciousness. This gives them a moment to say\ngoodbye to their character in a way that feels important\nand satisfying.\nBlaze of Glory\nIf the player decides that their character will go out in a\nBlaze of Glory, work with them to ensure that the one action\nthey take is as meaningful as possible without breaking the\nintegrity of the story. When the seraph goes out in a Blaze\nof Glory, you might rule that their final attack is fatal, even\nif the adversary had more HP left than a critical success\ncould possibly deal. But it might be a bad idea to let that\nsame seraph shatter the barrier between the Mortal Realm\nand the Hallows Above to allow their god to walk freely\namong mortals. Consider the group’s agreements about tone\nestablished in your session zero when deciding the scale of\naction the Blaze of Glory can accomplish.\n182 \tChapter 3: Running a Session\n\n-- 183 of 415 --\n\nWHEN DISASTER LOOMS\nThere are times when a fight goes poorly for the PCs and\nthey’re bound for total disaster. When multiple PCs are\nmaking death moves and there’s a real risk that everyone will\ndie, it’s important to check in with the players as the scene\nunfolds. How do they feel about the scene and the chance that\nthe whole party will be left dead or incapacitated? Is this a\ngood place for the campaign’s story to potentially end? Should\nthe PCs cut their losses and flee? Since PCs that choose Avoid\nDeath are helpless without assistance, the party is left at the\nmercy of their adversaries or fate (the GM) if every PC takes\nthat option.\nIt’s also useful to consider the motivation of the adversaries\npresent. Do the adversaries want to kill the PCs, or do they\njust want the party out of the way so they can pursue their\nmotives? Would they be more likely to leave the PCs for dead,\ntake them prisoner to gloat, or capture them to\nextract information?\nIf your players aren’t interested in a heroic tragedy at the\nmoment, work with them to decide what makes sense in the\nscene. Death is a real threat in Daggerheart, but the game\nis always a collaboration. If the party is going to meet their\nend, it should be because everyone at the table wants to tell\nthat story. If the players don’t want the party to die here but\nit’s difficult to come up with a way they survive, look to their\nbackground questions and their relationships with factions\nand prominent NPCs. Are they taken captive by the enemy?\nDoes an old ally show up with reinforcements to drive off the\nenemies? Does an agent of the seraph’s god or a nature spirit\nfriendly to the druid whisk the PCs away to safety? Does an\nassociate of the Syndicate rogue provide cover for the PCs\nto withdraw?\nIf the group decides that their party’s story is done but they\nwant to continue the overall campaign, hold a mid-campaign\nsession zero to make new characters and figure out how to\nconnect this new party to the existing story in a way that\neveryone is excited about. The following section provides\nadditional guidance for introducing new characters, whether\none or two new PCs join the party or a new party picks up\nwhere the previous one left off.\nINTRODUCING A NEW CHARACTER\nIf a PC dies or retires from adventuring, you should collaborate\nwith the player between sessions to develop a new character\nfor them to play at the current level of the party. If your player\nand group want to, they can answer the usual connection\nquestions, giving them existing relationships to everyone in\nthe party. You can also advance the party’s story by taking a\nmore dramatic route—skip the normal connection questions\nand instead ask one or more of the following questions:\n• You have vital information the party needs to continue on\ntheir journey. What is it, and how did you obtain it?\n• You are in desperate need of help that only the party can\nprovide. What danger follows you, and what do you have\nfor the party in exchange?\n• You know somebody in the party very well and have\nsearched them out. What happened the last time you saw\nthis person, and why are you seeking them out now?\n• You lost your last adventuring party to something or\nsomeone terrible. What caused their downfall, and how is\nthis new party connected to those previous adventurers?\n• You are part of a faction that opposed the party, but now\nyou want to align with them. What happened that made\nyou seek them out, and how are you going to prove to the\nparty that you can be trusted?\n• You have been charged with delivering a lost item to a\nmember of the party. What is it, and what personal quest\nis it tied to that requires working with the party?\nLEVELING YOUR PARTY\nYou can level up your party any time you wish, though it’s\noften simplest to do so at the end of an important session—\nsuch as when your party reaches the end of a story arc (see\nthe “Planning a Story Arc” section on page 189). All players\nshould level up at the same time, following the “Level Up”\nsection on their character guide. Ask them to reflect on what\ntheir character learned in the previous arc and how it might\nhave changed who they are, then choose two options from the\nlist in their Level Up guide.\nIf you are running a short campaign, you may want to level up\nevery other session (or whatever cadence feels appropriate for\nyour campaign length). This accelerates the power growth of\nyour PCs, but it also allows them to experience the full arc of\ntheir characters’ mechanics before the campaign ends.\nWhen your PCs level up, they’ll gain new abilities, spells,\ndamage thresholds, Experiences, and more, so be sure to\nreview what changed for them. This is a good time to plan\nopportunities for your players to use those new features over\nthe next arc. For example, if a PC’s new ability helps them\neavesdrop on conversations, you could begin the next session\nwith an espionage mission where that skill comes in handy.\nSimilarly, if a PC chooses the Animal Whisperer Experience,\nthey’d likely enjoy encountering wild animals that could be\ntamed during the upcoming arc.\n183\tChapter 3: Running a Session\n\n-- 184 of 415 --\n\nRUNNING A ONE-SHOT\nIf you want to run a one-shot—a short adventure that only\nspans one or two sessions—you can use the following guide\nto build out a quick collaborative session with your players.\nFirst, read the prologue aloud, and when you reach a blank,\nhave a player fill in the answer using one of the available\noptions. Move around the table, having players make decisions\nuntil all of the blanks are filled.\nThen read the completed prologue to the table. Feel free to\nask additional questions, clarify ideas, and expand upon the\ninformation until you all feel comfortable moving forward.\nPROLOGUE\nOur story takes place within the Kingdom of (1) \t.\nWe are currently traveling through (2) \t,\nbest known for (3) \t, and the\n(4) \tthat surround it.\n(1) Atheira | Bellsong | Helmrend | Ruumari | Winter’s Sun | Willowfell\n(2) Atlas | Dawnhollow | Indigo’s Shadow | Rathmire | The Wonder\n(3) its massive spires | its sacred wards | the Great Tree | the\nmysterious powers that keep it afloat | the shimmer hiding it\n(4) blistering deserts | dark forests | dense jungles | towering mountains\nNow that you know where you’re beginning your story, follow\nthe same process for the adventure.\nADVENTURE\nAfter last night’s (1) \t, many\nhere have (2) \t.\nThis morning, we found out that the events of the previous\nevening (3) \t.\nTo fix this, we’ll need to (4) \t.\nOur story begins as we prepare to leave for the\n(5) \t, where we might find what\nwe’re looking for.\n(1) catastrophic fire | attack by the Horde | terrifying storm |\nassassination of the queen\n(2) been badly injured | decided to leave | been caught in a terrible\ncurse | started an uprising\n(3) left someone we care about here near death | destroyed the town’s\nprotection rune | awoke a throng of spirits | angered an ancient beast\n(4) search for a powerful moonstone relic | retrieve Magister Kharix |\nbring an offering to the Grave of the Gods | enlist a tricksome fae\n(5) Towers of Hyle | Broken Sea | Traveler’s End | town of Wildfar |\nkingdom’s capital | Highland Peaks\nNext, give your players a fifteen-minute break and answer\nthe prompts in the following section to prep your session.\nUse the answers as inspiration and build out any necessary\ndetails, including any adversaries you think your players might\nencounter during the session.\nGM PREP\nOnce the party leaves town, they find (1) \t.\nAs the party journeys toward their destination,\n(2) \t.\nAs the party reaches their objective, they discover\n(3) \t.\nWhen the party finally finds what they came for,\nthey learn: (4) \t.\n(1) remnants of last night’s events | something wild and dangerous |\nan ominous warning about their destination | they are being followed\n(2) they find something important that they missed before | an unlikely\nally joins them | a dangerous obstacle impedes their path | they\nunwittingly enter the home of a dangerous creature\n(3) the target is hidden or well-protected | somebody has come to\nintercept them | this place is unexpectedly dangerous | someone was\nexpecting them\n(4) somebody else is looking for it too | it’s not quite what they\nexpected | they need something else to succeed | accomplishing their\ngoal will put others in danger\nNext, think about the way the characters’ backgrounds\nmight tie into the options you and the players chose. Maybe\nthe wild and dangerous creature they find is the monster\na player referenced in their PC’s backstory, perhaps the\nmysterious land they travel through is a PC’s childhood home,\nor perhaps the NPC looking for the target is a character one\nof the PCs has history with. The more you incorporate the\nPCs’ backstories into the present adventure, the more you\nempower the members of your table to continue making bold\nchoices. When players have agency in story construction, it\nlessens the responsibility of GMing and welcomes everyone\ninto a shared adventure.\nFlesh out any further details as necessary, but don’t feel the\nneed to overprep. Now you’re ready to play!\n184 \tChapter 3: Running a Session\n\n-- 185 of 415 --\n\nRunning a Campaign\nYou’ve got your players, you’ve made your characters, and maybe you’ve even played a session to\nget a feel for the game. What’s next?\nMost tables will start a campaign: a series of connected\nsessions often played weekly or monthly that let everyone\nexplore their character’s story over an extended period of\ntime. When you decide to start a campaign together, you can\nkickstart your adventure using the guidance in this section,\nalong with the inspiration presented in chapter 5.\nIn Daggerheart, campaigns are intended to be personal,\nfocused, and responsive. The amount you plan before\ncharacter creation depends on you and your players’\npreferences, but the details players provide about their\ncharacters should be the primary scaffolding upon which you’ll\ncraft the majority of the campaign. Aside from overarching plot\nbeats, you’ll often be prepping just the material you need week\nafter week, letting the story evolve naturally through play.\nChapter 5—“Campaign Frames”—provides six scafoldings\nfor different campaigns. If you’re an experienced GM, you may\nhave your own method of campaign prep—as always, feel free\nto utilize the pieces from this book that help and ignore the\npieces that don’t.\nCHOOSING A CAMPAIGN FRAME\nBefore your session zero, you might choose to implement a\ncampaign frame to ground the players in the type of fantasy\nstory you’re interested in as a GM. The fantasy genre is so\nwide—providing a campaign frame can give players a strong\njumping-off place to start brainstorming their characters.\nDaggerheart provides several campaign frames to start you\noff, but these shouldn’t limit the stories you tell with this\nsystem. If you have a strong idea about the kind of campaign\nyou want to run for your table, use the structure of the frames\nto build your own before your session zero.\nYou can find the following campaign frames in chapter 5:\nThe Witherwild\nWhen an invading nation attacks an ancient forest deity,\na virulent overgrowth spreads throughout the land.\nFive Banners Burning\nLong-brewing tensions between rival nations boil over,\nthreatening all-out war.\nBeast Feast\nWhen a small village’s monster defense system fails, the\nlocal heroes must venture into the endless caverns below\nto fix it—and cook up trouble for the creatures that stand\nin their way!\nThe Age of Umbra\nIn a dying world immersed in relentless shadow and\nnightmarish monsters, small communities hold fast to the\nlight, hoping those who endure can find a way to save this\nbroken realm before all is lost to darkness.\nMotherboard\nIn a world where magic takes the form of the technology\nleft behind by a long-fallen civilization, a new threat rises\nas a malicious virus spreads through the machines that\nwander the Wastes.\nColossus of the Drylands\nA prosperous region of gunslingers and outlaws has fallen\ninto terror as colossal creatures awaken from beneath the\nearth.\n185\t185\tChapter 3: Running a Campaign\n\n-- 186 of 415 --\n\nBUILDING A MAP\nAt the start of a campaign, one of the most important\nquestions to answer is “Where are we?” To do this, you’ll\nchoose one of the blank maps in the appendix or create your\nown, then print a copy of it out for your table. If you’re utilizing\na campaign frame, use the map detailed in that section.\nDigital copies of these maps are available on the Daggerheart\nwebsite for download.\nIf you know at character creation that you’ll be running a\ncampaign, you can bring a blank map to your session zero\nto fill out together. Otherwise, you can always introduce it\nat the top of your next session to integrate into your game\nmoving forward.\nTo start, place the map on the table and explain to the players\nthat you’ll be using it to build the region together. Choose the\nname of the region from the options available (or make up\nyour own) and write that name on the sheet. If you’re using a\ncampaign frame, the name of the region is provided for you.\nNext, remind the players about any locations they have\nalready created for the setting. Pass the map around and have\nthem label the locations they created anywhere they’d like.\nThen, choose one of the locations from the list on the sheet\nand add it to the map. Describe this place for the rest of the\ntable—what is it? Why is it called this? What makes it so\nsignificant? Then pass the map to another player to do the\nsame. Encourage them to tie in their character’s backstory\nor history with the new location if they wish. As players\ndescribe the locations they’ve chosen, record any important\ninformation about them in your notes.\nThe map should continue around the table like this until it\nfeels like it is populated with enough exciting locations and\nplot hooks for you to work with. With four players, twice\naround the table is usually enough. Remember, you can\nalways do this again at the start of another session to fill out\nthe map further, or even introduce a new region that connects\nto the current one.\nAfter the table feels happy with the details they’ve added, take\nthe map back and begin the adventure. Maybe it’s somewhere\nthe players have already added, or maybe it’s a new place—\neither way, this will help you orient yourself for the campaign\nmoving forward.\nFILLING SPACE, LEAVING\nBLANKS\nAs part of the prep for your next session, you’ll want to\nreview the map your table built together. Think about how\nthe locations your players created might affect the region,\nand add anything you think might be important or relevant to\nthe sheet. For example, if someone labeled a spot with “The\nHealing Fields,” you might consider adding a town nearby that\nspecializes in creating Health Potions or curing ailments, or\na mage’s tower that overlooks the fields to protect them. Pay\nattention to where the PCs currently are in their journey—\nwhere might they consider going next?\nIt’s also important to leave blanks. Don’t feel the need to fill\neverything in, and don’t worry about planning out what every\nlabeled landmark or town is like. Leaving some things vague\ngives you the freedom to adapt on the fly and reduces the\namount of worldbuilding work you have to do for places your\nplayers might never visit.\n186 \tChapter 3: Running a Campaign\n\n-- 187 of 415 --\n\nINCORPORATING PLAYER\nBACKSTORIES\nOne of the most important tools in a GM’s arsenal is to ask\nyour players questions and incorporate their answers—their\nresponses will tell you what they find exciting. The most\nimportant details to utilize while building a campaign are the\nanswers to a character’s Background Questions.\nThe Background Questions are designed to generate story\nhooks the players care about, which you can leverage for\nnarrative fodder during the campaign. Take good notes during\ncharacter creation and ask follow-up questions. Don’t be\nafraid to dig deeper into anything the players offer up during\nthis process. If they make up a person, ask them for their\nname. If they invent a place, ask them what it’s called and\nwhat it’s like. Ensure you record at least one or two things\nabout the world that are important to each player and their\ncharacter. The more you incorporate these things into the\ncampaign, the more invested that player tends to become.\nBACKSTORY NOTES\nAfter character creation, create a simple list of important narrative elements the players have given you, sorted by character.\nFor example, you might make the following notes about the PCs:\nMarigold Seok (She/Her)—Seaborne Elf Ranger\nPlayed by Kate (she/her)\nBorn in the floating city of Bloomfare. Had to leave her mother\nbehind to go on the run.\nShe is being chased down by the leaders of the Four\nElementals for stealing their stone of power during the\nlast ceremony.\nBarnabas Britespite (He/Him)—Loreborne Simiah Wizard\nPlayed by Asa (he/him)\nObsessed with finding relics, treasures, and bones of\nlegendary creatures. He thinks these should be collected and\nutilized for various practical purposes, not stashed away into\nmuseums. Wants to gather as much knowledge as he can in\nhis lifetime. Uses bone runes to cast magic.\nServed as the advisor to King Guthril, but failed to protect the\nking’s daughter Nira from being killed by wild beasts during\nher first hunt with him. Left the kingdom in shame.\nIs chasing down the fang of the great dragon Krugthar,\nbecause it is said to contain knowledge of every creature the\ndragon has ever consumed.\nIs rivals with Maverick, a snobby human treasure hunter who\nis trying to collect all the bones of legendary creatures to put\nthem in a museum.\nJasper Flores (They/Them)—Highborne Halfling Bard\nPlayed by Emerson (they/them)\nGrew up in The Sunbearer’s Crescent with the royal\nGalamore family of halflings. Was in a secret relationship with\nthe princess, Astrid Galamore. They had a secret place they\nwould meet.\nAstrid and Jasper were supposed to run away together, but\nshe never showed up. Jasper still wonders what happened.\nThere are rumors that she was forced to marry someone else.\nWas trained by Mage Yaro within Illiat’s Tower. Yaro is the one\nwho convinced them to travel the world and learn all they can.\nThey look up to a fellow bard named Quill who plays at the\nGolden Goose in The Sunbearer’s Crescent. Jasper met Quill\nthrough Yaro.\nSprout Hilldweller (She/Her)—Wanderborne Fungril Druid\nPlayed by Chen (she/her)\nWas chased out of the city of Branishar because she\naccidentally spent too much time there and decimated the\nenvironment around her. She’s learned she has to keep\nmoving: she can’t stay in one place for too long or bad\nthings happen.\nShe uses her Death Connection ability to absorb and\nmemorialize the core memories of all people she’s slain.\nShe sometimes forgets those histories aren’t her own.\n187\tChapter 3: Running a Campaign\n\n-- 188 of 415 --\n\nTYING BACKSTORIES TOGETHER\nOnce you’ve identified key points in each PC’s story, identify\nwhich of these pieces of information could be related—how\nthese stories could potentially cross paths—and draw some\nconnections between them.\nMaybe Maverick, the snobby human treasure collector that\nBarnabas is rivals with, could be the same person that Astrid\nGalamore, the halfling princess, was forced to marry? And if\nthat’s the case, what if Maverick was now forcing Mage Yaro\nto use his magic to invade the fungril network and seize more\ngreat treasures around the world without having to leave the\nkingdom? This would create a crossover between Jasper,\nSprout, and Barnabas, so it seems like a good place to start\nour campaign. But let’s keep thinking.\nThis type of conflict would likely eventually lead them to\nreturn to the Galamore kingdom to stop Maverick. This\njourney could be hindered by the fungril forces Mage Yaro\nis controlling, giving Sprout an opportunity to interact with\nthe corrupted network and get hints of what is to come in a\nway nobody else would be able to. And when they all finally\narrive in the Galamore kingdom, there could be a twist! Maybe\nAstrid convinced Quill, her and Jasper’s bard friend, to use\nshapeshifting magic to take her place right under Maverick’s\nnose so she could leave the kingdom and search for Jasper?\nThis could be a fun opportunity to flip the “princess in peril”\ntrope on its head and provide an unexpected reveal once\nthey reach the kingdom. If this is the case, we’ll also want\nto brainstorm a clue Astrid could leave behind at the secret\nplace where she and Jasper used to meet so the party can go\nafter her. But that’s down the road, no need to flesh that out\nimmediately.\nMarigold needs some love—maybe we could put the floating\ncity of Bloomfare in the great dragon Krugthar’s path of\ndestruction? This would push Marigold to return home and\nface the consequences of her actions to save her mother’s\nlife, while giving Barnabas an opportunity to chase down\nthe dragon he wants so badly. But given they’ll have to face\na dragon, this should probably be later in the campaign. So\nperhaps in the interim, to keep Marigold’s backstory involved,\nwe could put some elemental creatures on the party’s trail\nintermittently as they travel. This will keep the threat of her\nhome and the reminder of what she did relevant until she\nmust return to confront them. Maybe we even make that our\nfirst encounter of the campaign to set up that long-running\ndanger and tie Marigold in at the start.\nA few extra threads to tie up—Sprout should probably have to\ndeal with what she did in Branishar. Either she faces signs of\nthe same thing happening wherever she travels, or something\npushes her to return home. Barnabas should probably discover\nsomething unexpected about Nira’s death—could she still be\nalive? If so, maybe she finds him to reveal that her father King\nGuthril secretly set up an ambush to have her killed. It wasn’t\nBarnabas’s fault, and Nira wants revenge.\nThat’s more than enough for now! As the campaign plays out,\nthere will be plenty more to work with and some of these\nplans may change drastically—but this is a great foundation\nto work from.\n188 \tChapter 3: Running a Campaign\n\n-- 189 of 415 --\n\nPLANNING A STORY ARC\nNow that we have some ideas of what could potentially\nhappen in our campaign, it’s time to talk about story arcs.\nArcs are a connected series of sessions within a campaign\nthat focus on a specific objective, theme, character, or idea.\nThough you won’t know for sure the path your players will\ntake, by preparing the structure of the arc, you can ensure\nthat you’re giving them the adequate narrative fodder for a\nsatisfying story.\nArcs are typically between three to five sessions in length,\nthough they can be longer depending on how large of a\ncampaign you’re running. It’s usually good to start small and\nbuild up to larger arcs as players get more invested in the\nstory you’re telling together, but an arc’s structure typically\nremains the same regardless of the length.\nThere are a few different structures that stories often\ntake, but we’re going to use the Three-Act Structure as\nour framework because it is the most common and is the\neasiest to identify in many of today’s movies and TV shows.\nAs always, feel free to experiment with your own style of\nstorytelling and only use the things from this section that help\nyou at your table!\nThe Three-Act Structure is pretty straightforward—Act One is\nthe introduction, Act Two is the trials and tribulations, and Act\nThree is the finale.\nThis is something we see in almost every popular movie or\nTV show—a character wants something, they work hard and\nface challenges to get that thing, and finally succeed or fail.\nEither way, they always change because of the journey they\nwent through. Because of this, it’s often what players expect\nout of a good story, even if they don’t know it. It’s what feels\nsatisfying to us, because it’s the way we’re used to seeing\nstories. We can utilize that expectation in our prep to make\nour work easier.\nLet’s take the example from the previous “Tying Backstories\nTogether” section to form our first arc. Given how much the\nNPC Maverick is intertwined in multiple PCs’ backstories,\nhe’s going to be our focus here, since that will give almost\neveryone a chance to have their backstories interwoven\ninto the story at the start. Maverick is the snobby human\ntreasure collector who is Barnabas’s rival, and we’ve made the\ndecision that Maverick is the one who stole Astrid Galamore’s\nhand in marriage, even though she has been in love with our\nparty’s bard Jasper since childhood. Because Maverick is now\nresiding in the kingdom with her, we’ve also decided that he\nis forcing Jasper’s old mentor, Mage Yaro, to use his arcane\npowers to tap into the expansive fungril network and hunt\nfor treasure remotely, disrupting Sprout’s connection to the\nfungril network. And on their way to the kingdom, there will be\nno waiting around for the perfect opportune moment to act,\nbecause Marigold has a set of powerful elemental leaders hot\non her trail.\nACT ONE: COLLISION\nLet’s make an event collide with our party that they can’t\nignore. It’s often best to go to the most obvious answers\nfirst, then complicate things from there. In this case, let’s set\nup Maverick going after an artifact that the party has been\nasked to protect. If he’s using the fungril network to do it,\nthen perhaps Maverick has Yaro create plantlike creatures\nfilled with the fungus that he can control! There’s our first act\nencounter—and we can build the rest of this act from there.\nThe most important thing to keep in mind about Act One is\nthat you want to use it to introduce a bigger conflict the party\nwill encounter later—give them a taste of what’s to come\nand draw them into the arc’s story. Using the techniques in\nthe earlier “Running a Session” section, after you’ve played\nthrough Act One with your table, you might end up with\nsomething like this:\nBeat One: On their way to the city of Helayre, the party runs\nacross the damage left behind by elementals—Marigold\nrecognizes the work of those chasing her.\nBeat Two: As the party arrives in Helayre, they notice that\nlarge plants have overwhelmed everything. They also meet\nkind townsfolk who tell them about the attacks on the city\nby plant creatures at night. Upon inquiry, they’ll be taken to\nwhere the attacks are the worst—the university.\nBeat Three: At the university, the students all know Barnabas\nby name—the headmistress, Olivia Rose, is a proponent of his\nwork. She shows the party what the plant creatures are after:\nthe Stone Soul, belonging to a griffin from the hidden island\nof Boga Tiren. Olivia’s parents disappeared searching for Boga\nTiren when she was a kid, and she has spent her life looking\nfor them. If they extract the memory of its location from one\nof the plant creatures, then maybe she can find the island.\nBeat Four: Olivia captured a plant creature that attacked.\nWhen Sprout uses Death Connection, she learns it’s full of tiny\nmushrooms. She gets clearer flashes of the mage in a nearby\nport town. He cries out for help, looking pained. The mage is\nconsumed by a memory in which a voice tells him to “get to\nthe stone.”\nBeat Five: Plant creatures descend on the university. The\nparty must hold them back and defend the Stone Soul. As the\nfinal creature goes down in battle, the party hears the mage’s\nvoice seep through it—the voice calls out to Jasper with a\nnickname familiar only to Yaro. With the planet creatures\ndefeated and Yaro revealed, Act One is complete.\nThough the party’s decisions might require you to adapt or\nmake changes, this framework will help you use Act One to\nset up the rest of the arc. It creates questions for the PCs to\nchase—why is Yaro doing this? Why did he sound scared? Who\nwas giving him orders? Could it be Maverick, looking for relics?\nAnd also—Where is Boga Tiren? Why is it hidden? Dramatic\nquestions like these drive the PCs forward into Act Two.\n189\tChapter 3: Running a Campaign\n\n-- 190 of 415 --\n\nACT TWO: COMPLICATIONS\nIn Act Two, the PCs are thrust into a journey to answer their\nbig questions. Before the end of Act One, you should confirm\nwhich direction they’re going to go before you dive into\nplanning—they’ll almost certainly want to figure out what’s\nhappening with Mage Yaro, but what if they decide to instead\nescort Professor Rose to Boga Tiren? Or something else\nentirely? It’s often best to lead from behind as you approach\nAct Two—let the players show you the questions they want to\nanswer most, then fill in the gaps as they move toward finding\nthose answers.\nOnce the party is off on this quest, Act Two is all about the\ncomplications that get in the way. As you prep for these next\nsessions, the complications should matter—they should be\npersonal and speak to the themes and tone of the campaign.\nIf, for example, the party decides to head north to the\nGalamore kingdom to find out what’s happening with Mage\nYaro, we know they’ll be on the road for a few days to get\nup there. It might be tempting to throw in a few random\nencounters with wild animals, some people asking for help\nwith unrelated issues, or some rolls to see how well they’re\nable to survive the distant travel, but Act Two is all about\nbuilding up to a climactic finale. So what can we do instead to\nmake it feel like a story, rather than just time passing before\nwe get to the Galamore kingdom?\nWe know Barnabas is searching for the legendary dragon\nKrugthar, and we’re likely going to have a future arc (when\nthe players are higher level) centered around his attack on\nBloomfare (Marigold’s home). One option is to foreshadow\nthat event and show the dragon’s power. Maybe we put a\nvillage decimated by fire on their path, the village’s mage dead\nand the ruins gouged with immense claw marks. Those alive\ntalk about an attack by a massive flying beast that disappeared\ninto the sun—something Barnabas will immediately recognize\nas Krugthar. But to give the players something to act on now,\nmaybe the beast had small companions or minions that could\nbe creating havoc in the village, dragging important NPCs into\nthe forest, or shapeshifting to replace normal citizens. You can\nchange this encounter depending on the kind of challenge your\ntable enjoys.\nWe also know from Sprout’s backstory that if she stays\nsomewhere too long, she rots away everything around her—\nperhaps we see the devastating effect that Maverick and\nYaro had on the environment. Perhaps the party encounters\ntwisted arcane creatures riddled with fungus and struggles\nto traverse a sickly land. These events serve as a reminder to\nSprout of the place she decimated and the destruction she left\nbehind. She could have the chance at a bit of redemption here,\nor at least knowledge of this kind of blight that helps keep her\nfriends safe.\nAnother option might be to encounter an additional place\nwhere Maverick’s fungril creatures successfully stole another\nartifact of power—but this relic is something that can be\nconsumed to steal another person’s arcane power. Perhaps we\ndecide this was the plan along, for Maverick to use Yaro until\nhe could absorb his magic himself. Even without knowing the\nfull context, the PCs will likely rush to the Galamore kingdom\nas fast as they can, knowing this powerful object has fallen\ninto the wrong hands.\nWhatever the journey may entail, once the PCs have reached\nthe kingdom to confront Yaro and learn about Maverick, we\nenter the final act of our arc.\nACT THREE: CLIMAX\nAct Three will usually see our PCs resolve some of the big\nquestions they have and face off against the powerful force\nthey’ve been preparing for through Act One and Act Two.\nIdentify which answers the players are most excited about\ndiscovering and provide at least some of those answers in this\nact. Oftentimes, these answers are what launch the next arc\nof your campaign—having an idea of what they are going into\nthis act will help you prepare for what’s to come.\nThough not absolutely mandatory, it’s also always a good idea\nto plan some sort of reveal, surprise, or twist in this act—\nsomething that isn’t quite what it seems. These plot twists\nkeep the players on their toes and make them excited to find\nout what will happen next. In the case of our current example,\nwe have a few twists prepared—Yaro is being controlled by\nMaverick, who has squirmed his way into the kingdom by\nmarrying Astrid Galamore, Jasper’s childhood love.\nAs we prepare this act, we should identify the questions we\nare going to answer—things like “Who is forcing Yaro to do\nthis?” and “What happened to Astrid?” It’s important to think\nthrough what Maverick would do to keep himself safe and Yaro\nunder his control. Perhaps he orders the king’s guard to attack\nthe party when they enter the city, putting Jasper in conflict\nwith the very people they grew up with. Maybe the kingdom\nis locked down and the drawbridge raised, forcing the group\nto find another way in. Think about how you can create a last\nset of complications that ramps up the tension until the final\nconfrontation is inevitable.\nThe arc will end with a showdown between Maverick and\nthe party. Maybe he still has Yaro under his control and\nuses the mage as a weapon against them. Maybe he has\nabsorbed Yaro’s arcane power using the relic he stole and is\nnow attacking the party with magic himself. Maybe he has\nturned coward and is attempting to flee with Astrid through a\nsecret tunnel beneath the castle. Whatever the encounter is, it\nshould be a big, exciting, and dangerous ending to the arc that\nties up some of the loose ends and creates an opportunity for\nmore adventure in the next arc.\n190 \tChapter 3: Running a Campaign\n\n-- 191 of 415 --\n\nLONG-FORM PLAY\nJust as an arc is a collection of scenes and sessions, a\ncampaign can be thought of as a collection of arcs. The\nshape of your campaign will depend on your campaign frame\n(whether you’re using a formal frame or not)—a campaign\nfocused on the PCs rising to prominence as gladiators in\none city-state will have a different shape than a grand tour\ncampaign where PCs travel the world collecting the artifacts\nneeded to defeat a world-ending threat. Some campaigns may\nbe more episodic, with individual and seemingly disconnected\nadventures that eventually culminate into a larger story, and\nothers might be a more serial narrative of unfolding arcs.\nDepending on your campaign, each story arc might end in the\nparty leveling up, or a story arc might span across an entire\ntier of play (levels 2 through 4, 5 through 7, etc.). There’s no\nwrong way to plan as long as it serves your needs as a GM and\nthe players are enjoying the game. A longer campaign (closer\nto eight to ten sessions per level) may have several story arcs\nper level or more complex story arcs, plots with red herrings\nor tough choices that force the PCs to decide between\nsimultaneous threats. Then you can take the plots that the\nplayers did not focus on and progress them so that when the\nPCs do get around to addressing them, the situations have\nescalated.\nA few sessions into a campaign, once everyone has a solid\nsense of their characters and their motivations, you can\nexplore options for longer-term planning and how to help\nthe group execute on the table’s creative intentions for the\ncampaign. Look at the background answers and connections,\nespecially ones that haven’t yet been explored. Ask yourself\nhow these elements could work with what’s already happened\nin the story. If a central character relationship between PCs\nalready changed, what external events or situations could\nenrich or complicate that relationship? What elements of\ncharacter backstory could provide dramatic contrast to how a\ncharacter has presented themselves so far? What elements of\nthe setting would be impacted by what’s already happened in\nthe story? What threats have grown while the PCs were taking\naction elsewhere?\nCONSTRUCTING ARCS\nImagine a rope. You have dozens of smaller cords twisted\naround one another to create something stronger and longer\nlasting than any one thread could be as an individual. That\nrope is a story arc, and the cords are the plots that weave\ntogether to craft it. While the rope always starts frayed, the\ncords tighten around one another as the story unfolds to\ncreate a cohesive and satisfying narrative.\nWe build story arcs by breaking them into three or four\nsessions that each cover a major plot beat. These beats\nare created when we intertwine several ongoing storylines,\nwhich we’ll call A-, B-, and C-plots. As you chart out arcs,\nyou’ll determine which storylines to prioritize when they best\ndeserve focus. By threading storylines into beats, then those\nbeats into arcs, you can weave the arcs together into one\nthrilling, cohesive campaign.\nA-PLOT: The star of the show, often dealing with the primary\naction of a session. Early in a campaign, this typically involves\ntaking the first steps into revealing a larger world and a\nlooming threat. As a campaign moves forward, A-plots will fall\naway as B- and C-plots rise into their place.\nB-PLOT: This plot is flexible and often throws a wrench into\nthe gears turning the A-plot, forcing the party to divert their\nattention. The B-plot in one arc should become the A-plot in\nthe next.\nC-PLOT: The least-featured plot thread in an arc or beat, the\nC-Plot exists to seed upcoming and important plot threads.\nThese are best used sparingly—you’ll know you did it right\nwhen a late-campaign revelation has a trail of breadcrumbs,\nonly visible in hindsight, leading back to some of the earliest\nstory points. C-plots often become B-plots in subsequent arcs.\nYou can always inject a D/E/F-plot into the story if it calls for\nit. But even if you have more than three major plot threads\nin your story, focusing on three in any given session will help\nkeep everything manageable.\nIn the table below, you’ll see four example narratives:\n“Marigold’s Four Elementals,” “Sprout’s Power,” “Krugthar’s\nDestruction,” and “Yaro’s Return,” and how they might weave\ntogether into a three-arc campaign.\nA LARGER PLOT\nWhen you run a campaign, you might prefer to have PCs explore a number of smaller arcs using the structure above. You can\nalso nest this structure within one overarching plot. In heroic adventures, this often manifests as a quest to stop the villain,\nprotect the kingdom, or save the world—a challenge the PCs must overcome that affects the wider world and the people in it. If\nyou want to include a larger plot, it will appear more or less in each session, remaining throughout your story until the characters\nfinally arrive at the climax of the campaign.\nExample Long-Term Arcs\nArc \t1 \t2 \t3\nSession \t1 \t2 \t3 \t1 \t2 \t3 \t4 \t1 \t2 \t3 \t4\nMarigold’s Four Elementals \tA-Plot \tA-Plot \tA-Plot\nSprout’s Power \tB-Plot \tB-Plot \tA-Plot \tA-Plot \tA-Plot \tA-Plot\nKrugthar’s Destruction \tB-Plot \tB-Plot \tB-Plot \tA-Plot \tA-Plot \tA-Plot \tA-Plot\nYaro’s Return \tC-Plot \tC-Plot \tC-Plot \tB-Plot \tB-Plot \tB-Plot\n191\tChapter 3: Running a Campaign\n\n-- 192 of 415 --\n\n\n\n-- 193 of 415 --\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\nAdversaries and Environments\nThis chapter presents the rules and stat blocks for adversaries and environments.\nUsing Adversaries\nThis section describes how to use each adversary’s stat block,\nwhile the “Armed Conflict” section in chapter 3 presents\ngeneral rules for running combat and tying these scenes into\nthe larger story. Finally, the upcoming “Adversary Stat Blocks”\nsection presents statistics for each adversary, grouped by tier\nto represent their general threat level.\nADVERSARY BREAKDOWN\nEach adversary’s stat block presents the statistics, or\nmechanical information, you need to use them in combat.\nName\nEach stat block has a unique name—see the Jagged Knife\nBandit stat block example below. Abilities that affect\nadversaries with a certain name include all adversaries who\nuse that stat block, regardless of their in-story name.\nTier\nEach adversary is designed to oppose PCs of a certain tier.\nYou can use stat blocks from other tiers, but you might\nwant to adjust their statistics as described in the upcoming\n“Improvising Adversaries” section. Tier 1 adversaries are\nappropriate for level 1 characters, Tier 2 for levels 2–4, Tier 3\nfor levels 5–7, and Tier 4 for levels 8–10.\nType\nThe adversary’s type appears alongside their tier. The Jagged\nKnife Bandit is a Standard adversary, meaning they’re an\naverage member of their faction’s forces. The following\n“Adversary Types” section details possible adversary roles.\nDescription\nA summary of the adversary’s appearance and demeanor.\nMotives & Tactics\nEach stat block contains the adversary’s motives and tactics.\nWhen in doubt, the bandit tries to escape (caring more for\ntheir own life than victory), profit (by any means necessary,\nincluding lying and stealing), and throw smoke (obscuring the\nbattlefield and escape route). These motives and tactics are\nsuggestions rather than rules—feel free to improvise their\nchoices as you would when playing any NPC.\nDifficulty\nAdversaries don’t use Evasion like PCs—instead, all rolls\nagainst them use their Difficulty. The bandit has a Difficulty of\n12, so a roll of 12 or higher succeeds against this adversary.\nIf an adversary’s feature doesn’t specify a Difficulty (like an\nAgility Reaction Roll), it always uses the adversary’s Difficulty.\nDamage Thresholds, Hit Points, and Stress\n“Thresholds: 8/14” represents this adversary’s damage\nthresholds—so their Major threshold is 8 and their Severe\nthreshold is 14. The bandit has 5 Hit Points and 3 Stress.\nThese systems function the same way they do for PCs.\nAttack Modifier\nWhen you attack with the adversary, apply this bonus or\npenalty to your attack roll.\nStandard Attack\nEach adversary has a standard attack listed next to\ntheir attack modifier, which contains the attack’s name\n(Daggers), its range (Melee), and its damage on a success\n(1d8+1 physical damage). You can use this standard attack\nas an action.\nExperience\nLike PCs, some adversaries have Experiences that make\nthem especially capable in certain situations. This adversary’s\nExperience is Thief +2, which can aid them in rolls related\nto skulduggery. See the upcoming “Adversary Experiences”\nsection for further details.\nFeatures\nFeatures represent the bandit’s capabilities in a conflict. There\nare three kinds of features: passives, actions, and reactions.\nFor example, the bandit has a passive called “From Above”\nthat deals more damage when they’re attacking from above—\nthe 1d10+1 damage replaces their standard attack’s 1d8+1.\nThe upcoming “Adversary Features” section details how to use\nvarious features.\nJAGGED KNIFE BANDIT\nTier  Standard\nA cunning criminal in a cloak bearing one of the gang’s iconic knives.\nMotives & Tactics: Escape, profi t, steal, throw smoke\nDifficulty: 12 | Thresholds: 8/14 | HP: 5 | Stress: 3\nATK: +1 | Daggers: Melee | 1d8+1 phy\nExperience: Thief +2\nFEATURES\nClimber - Passive: The Bandit climbs just as easily as they run.\nFrom Above - Passive: When the Bandit succeeds on a standard\nattack from above a target, they deal 1d10+1 physical damage\ninstead of their standard damage.\n193\tChapter 4: Adversaries and Environments\n\n-- 194 of 415 --\n\nADVERSARY TYPES\nAn adversary’s type represents the role they play in a conflict.\nWhen building encounters, utilizing a mix of types helps\ncreate a dynamic and engaging challenge. The adversary types\nare as follows:\n• Bruisers are tough and deliver powerful attacks.\n• Hordes are groups of identical creatures acting together\nas a single unit.\n• Leaders command and summon other adversaries.\n• Minions are easily dispatched but dangerous in numbers.\n• Ranged are fragile in close encounters but can attack from\na distance for high damage.\n• Skulks maneuver and exploit opportunities to ambush\nopponents.\n• Socials present unique challenges to overcome through\nconversation rather than combat.\n• Solos present a formidable challenge to a whole party,\nwith or without support.\n• Standards are rank-and-file adversaries representative of\ntheir fictional group.\n• Supports enhance their allies and disrupt their opponents.\nADVERSARY EXPERIENCES\nAdversaries tend to have fewer but broader Experiences than\nPCs. In situations where you think an adversary’s capabilities\nwould come into play, you can spend a Fear to apply an\nExperience modifier to their Difficulty, attack rolls, and\nreaction rolls as follows:\nDifficulty\nWhen a PC makes an action roll against an adversary, you can\nspend a Fear to add a relevant Experience modifier to the roll’s\nDifficulty.\nAdversary Attack and Reaction Rolls\nWhen an adversary makes an attack or reaction roll, you can\nspend a Fear to add a relevant Experience modifier to the roll.\nWhen you use an adversary’s Experience, describe how it\nimproves their odds at performing that action. Experiences\nfeel more impactful if you save them for certain dramatic\nmoments or situations, rather than applying them to\nmost rolls.\nWhile some adversaries specialize in combat, others do best\nin nonviolent situations, and their Experiences reflect that.\nFor example, the Tier 1 Merchant has the Experience “Shrewd\nNegotiator +3” that can apply whenever a PC tries to haggle\nwith them, increasing the Difficulty to 15 to reflect their keen\nbusiness acumen.\nExample Experiences\nYou can always adjust a stat block’s Experiences to fit your\nstory. Here are examples of Experiences you can use:\nAcrobatics \tHunt from Above \tNavigation\nAmbusher \tIntimidation \tNobility\nBartering \tIntrusion \tQuick Reflexes\nBlademaster \tKeen Senses \tSocialite\nBodyguard \tMagical Knowledge \tStealth\nCommander \tNature’s Friend \tTracker\nADVERSARY FEATURES\nThe bottom of each stat block lists the adversary’s features.\nFeatures can take three forms—actions, reactions, and\npassives. The following sections describe how to use these\nfeatures and provide a few examples.\nTip: If an adversary stat block mentions an “ally,”\nit’s referring to a fellow adversary, not a PC.\nActivating Features\nFor an adversary to use an action, they must have the\nspotlight. Passives and reactions typically don’t require\nthe spotlight. Some features require you to use additional\nresources, such as:\n• Marking Stress\nSome moves call for you to “mark a Stress,” meaning you\nmark 1 Stress on the adversary. Other, more powerful\nmoves might tell you to “mark 2 Stress” or more. Each\nadversary’s Stress is tracked individually; if one adversary\nmarks all their Stress, they can’t mark a different\nadversary’s Stress to use that move.\n• Spending Fear\nSome moves say to “spend a Fear.” Other, more powerful\nmoves might tell you to “spend 2 Fear” or more. To make\none of these moves, you must spend Fear as described,\neven if you already spent a Fear to spotlight the adversary.\nAdversary Tokens\nSome adversaries require tokens to be placed on their stat\nblocks for certain features. These adversary tokens are used\nas counters similar to the players’ character tokens.\n194 \tChapter 4: Using Adversaries\n\n-- 195 of 415 --\n\nAdversary Actions\nAdversary actions can be divided into three categories:\n• Standard Attacks\nEach adversary has a standard attack. This includes their\nattack modifier, the name of the attack, its range, and its\ndamage. When you spotlight an adversary, you can always\nuse their standard attack as long as they are within range\nor can move within range.\n• Unique Actions\nMany adversaries have special actions listed on the\nbottom of their stat block. These represent their innate\nabilities, magical talents, and other combat techniques.\nUnique actions might allow the adversary to make an\nattack, force PCs to make a reaction roll, or even change\nthe landscape. When you spotlight an adversary, you\ncan choose to use one of these instead of making a\nstandard attack.\n• Other Actions\nAdversaries can do nearly anything a PC can, so if you\nwant to do something that isn’t in the stat block, feel\nfree! The “Adversary Action Rolls” section in chapter 3\nprovides guidance for resolving other actions an adversary\nmight take.\nUNIQUE ACTION EXAMPLES\nThe following features are examples of unique actions. In\nthese examples, “X” represents a number that differs for\neach stat block.\nHaymaker - Action: Make an attack against a target within\nVery Close range. On a success, deal X direct physical\ndamage.\nShredding Strike - Action: Make an attack against a target\nwithin Very Close range. On a success, deal X physical\ndamage and the target must mark an Armor Slot without\ngaining its benefit (they can still use armor to reduce the\ndamage).\nAdversary Reactions\nAdversary reactions are features that don’t take effect\nuntil their specific trigger occurs (such as taking damage or\nmarking a certain number of HP). When it triggers, you can\nchoose to immediately use the reaction, and you don’t have\nto spend Fear to interrupt the PCs with this reaction (unless\notherwise specified). The following features are examples of\nreactions. In these examples, “X” represents a number that\ndiffers for each stat block.\nHeavy Hitter - Reaction: When this adversary deals damage\nwith a standard attack, you can spend a Fear to gain a +X\nbonus to the damage roll.\nTeam-Up - Reaction: When another adversary within Very\nClose range of thisadversary deals X damage to a creature,\nyou can mark a Stress to make a standard attack against\nthat same creature. On a success, combine the damage.\nMomentum - Reaction: When this adversary makes a\nsuccessful attack against a PC, you gain a Fear.\nAdversary Passives\nAdversary passives always apply under the circumstances\nstated in that feature. Some are always in effect (such as\nthe “Arcane Form” passive, which makes the adversary\npermanently resistant to magic damage). Others automatically\ncome into effect when the stated trigger occurs (such as the\n“Horde” passive, which reduces the adversary’s damage once\ntheir Hit Points are halved).\nThe following features are examples of passives. In these\nexamples, “X” represents a number that differs for each\nstat block.\nHorde (X) - Passive: When the Horde has marked half or\nmore of their HP, their standard attack deals X damage\ninstead.\nMinion (X) - Passive: This adversary is defeated when they\ntake any damage. For every X damage a PC deals to this\nadversary, defeat an additional Minion within range the\nattack would succeed against.\nRelentless (X) - Passive: This adversary can be spotlighted\nup to X times per GM turn. Spend Fear as usual to spotlight\nthem.\nTip: The “Relentless” feature is useful if you want an\nadversary who can act multiple times between PCs. This\nis often best for exceedingly fast or dangerous foes, or for\nadversaries who are likely to battle the party on their own.\nSlow - Passive: When you spotlight this adversary and they\ndon’t have a token on their stat block, they can’t act yet.\nPlace a token on their stat block and describe what they’re\npreparing to do. When you spotlight this adversary and\nthey have a token on their stat block, clear the token and\nthey can act.\nTip: The “Slow” feature is useful if you want an adversary\nwho narratively takes longer to act than others, like a giant\nslug or a lumbering ogre. This is usually most effective when\nthe creature has powerful actions that justify the delay.\nArcane Form - Passive: This adversary is resistant to magic\ndamage.\nArmored Carapace - Passive: When this adversary takes\nphysical damage, reduce it by X.\n195\tChapter 4: Using Adversaries\n\n-- 196 of 415 --\n\nFear Features\nFear Features are rare and powerful adversary features that\nrequire spending Fear to activate. These can take the form of\npassives, actions, or reactions. Each Fear Feature is a scene-\ndefining effect that justifies the expenditure of this valuable\nGM resource.\nExplosion - Action: Spend a Fear to erupt in a fiery\nexplosion. Make an attack against all targets within Close\nrange. Targets the adversary succeeds against take 1d8\nmagic damage and are knocked back to Far range.\nSummoning Features\nCertain features summon additional adversaries on the\nbattlefield. The summoned adversaries arrive at a specified\nrange relative to the adversary who used the feature. In the\nfollowing example, the Jagged Knife Lackeys would spawn\nat Far range from the Leader who summoned them. We\nrecommend you use these features when you feel the fight\nneeds to grow—either in duration or difficulty.\nMore Where That Came From - Action: Summon three\nJagged Knife Lackeys, who appear at Far range.\nSpotlighting Features\nSome features allow you to immediately spotlight one or more\nother adversaries. Unless otherwise specified, this doesn’t\nrequire spending Fear. When a feature tells you to spotlight\nmore than one adversary, you can choose the order in which\nthey act. While an adversary is spotlighted in this way, you\ncan’t use another spotlighting feature.\nTactician - Action: Mark a Stress to spotlight this adversary\nand two allies within Close range.\nRETURNING RULES\nThis section repeats a few rules from earlier chapters\nthat are helpful to remember while running adversaries.\nTargets and Groups\nOften an effect asks you to choose a target within range.\nThis means you choose a single creature to affect. When\nit makes sense in the story, you can target a single object\nin range, rather than a creature, adjusting the effects\nas needed.\nTo affect a group of targets, those targets must be\nclumped together in an area within Very Close range of a\npoint you choose. Regardless of the number of targets,\nyou only need to make one attack roll and compare that\ntotal to the Difficulty of each eligible target to determine\nwhich creatures you succeed against. When your attack\ndeals damage to more than one target, roll damage\nonce and apply the total to each target the attack\nsucceeded against.\nAttacking Multiple Targets\nBy default, an adversary can only hit one target\nwith their standard attack. When an adversary’s action\nlets you make an attack against multiple targets, you\nmake one attack roll and ask if it hits any of the targets.\nIf you’re making individual attacks with multiple\nadversaries during the same GM move, make\nan attack roll for each adversary.\n196 \tChapter 4: Using Adversaries\n\n-- 197 of 415 --\n\nChoosing\nAdversaries\nIt’s time to build a combat encounter!\nThe upcoming “Battle Guide” section gives a starting point\nfor building balanced encounters. The following pages break\ndown each type of adversary and provide guidance for\nbuilding your own.\nBATTLE GUIDE\nThis guide will help you roughly balance an encounter so you\ncan determine how many and which adversaries to use. You’ll\nfirst calculate your starting Battle Points, which determine\nyour budget for the encounter. Then you’ll adjust the budget\nup and down based on other factors. Finally, you’ll build the\nencounter, spending Battle Points to add adversaries until you\nhave no more to spend.\nWhen planning a battle, start with the following formula to\ncalculate how many Battle Points you should spend:\n(3 × the number of PCs in combat) + 2\nFor example, if you have a party of three PCs, you have 11 Battle\nPoints to spend. If you have a party of five, you have 17 Battle\nPoints to spend.\nKeep in mind that you might need to adjust this calculation as\nyou become more acquainted with your party and their power\nlevel.\nAdjusting Battle Points\nSome factors might increase or decrease your Battle Points\nbudget:\n• Subtract 1 point if the fight should be less difficult or\nshorter.\n• Subtract 2 points if you’re using 2 or more Solo\nadversaries.\n• Subtract 2 points if you add +1d4 (or a static +2) to\nall adversaries’ damage rolls (to increase the challenge\nwithout lengthening the battle).\n• Add 1 point if you choose an adversary from a lower tier.\n• Add 1 point if you don’t include any Bruisers, Hordes,\nLeaders, or Solos.\n• Add 2 points if the fight should be more dangerous\nor last longer.\nSpending Battle Points\nOnce you finish calculating your available Battle Points, craft\nyour combat encounter by spending points until you have\nnone left.\n• Spend 1 point for each group of Minions equal to the size\nof the party.\n• Spend 1 point for each Social or Support adversary.\n• Spend 2 points for each Horde, Ranged, Skulk, or\nStandard adversary.\n• Spend 3 points for each Leader adversary.\n• Spend 4 points for each Bruiser adversary.\n• Spend 5 points for each Solo adversary.\nTip: Some adversaries summon additional enemies when\nthey use their features—you don’t need to factor those into\nyour point total.\nExample: Ben is preparing an encounter for his party of four\nto help introduce a new enemy faction. Having four PCs\nmeans he starts with 14 Battle Points to spend. He wants\nthis encounter to be a little easier, so he adjusts his Battle\nPoints to 13. He spends 8 points on two Bruisers, 4 points\non two Standards, and 1 point on four Minions.\nLater, the party has followed the faction’s trail and\nconfronts a group on patrol near the faction’s outpost. Ben\nspends 10 points on five Standard adversaries, 2 points on\na Ranged adversary, and 2 points on eight Minions.\nAnd finally, because the party has fought through the\noutpost to confront the faction leader, Ben decides to make\nthe last fight more difficult. He decides he will add +2 to all\nadversary’s damage rolls, giving him 12 points to spend.\nWith this budget, he spends 3 points on a Leader, 4 points\non a Bruiser, 4 points on two Hordes, and 1 point on a\nSupport. The Leader also has an action that can bring in\nMinions as needed.\n197\tChapter 4: Choosing Adversaries\n\n-- 198 of 415 --\n\nBRUISER\nA towering giant, a muscle-bound bodyguard for a devious\nmerchant, a hulking construct with fists of iron—this is the\nBruiser. These heavyweights can take significant punishment\nand deal powerful blows.\nMechanics\nBruisers are close-quarter combatants. They usually engage\nthe party’s melee characters while other adversaries attack\nfrom range. They deal high damage and often use area\nattacks. Sometimes they have the “Slow” feature to play\nup their lumbering nature, or features that move the PCs\naround to display their power. If you’re using minis in your\nencounters, consider ones with larger bases to convey their\nsize—bigger minis usually imply a larger threat!\nArchetypal Example\nThe Minotaur Wrecker is a paramount example of the Bruiser:\nbig, lumbering, and extremely dangerous. At Tier 2, these\njuggernauts typically deal Major damage and can land Severe\nblows on more lightly armored PCs. Their “Ramp Up” passive\nmeans they’re more costly to spotlight, but they can attack\nall targets within range with their standard attack. With their\n“Gore” action, they charge into combat and make big dents in\narmored units.\nCustom Bruisers\nWhen creating a Bruiser, keep in mind the following\nguidelines. Offensively, a Bruiser’s attack modifiers are usually\naverage or lower, and most of their attacks deal Major or\nSevere damage (as appropriate for their tier). Defensively,\nthey have average or lower Difficulty, higher than average Hit\nPoints, and slightly higher than average damage thresholds.\nMaking Your Own\nImagine an ogre rising from the grave—let’s call them a Dire\nWight! This hulking creature might be found feasting on\ntheir latest kill or patrolling the outskirts of an ancient castle.\nThis powerful guardian carries a terrifying two-handed mace\nenchanted with the last cries of their victims. We’ll make them\nat Tier 3.\n• Since the wight is a larger, lumbering creature and thus\neasy to target, a Difficulty of 15 works well.\n• We want to make the wight easier to hit, but harder to\ndamage, so let's give them a Major threshold of 26, and a\nSevere threshold of 42. We can also give them 8 HP and 4\nStress.\n• Because they are so big, the wight doesn’t attack as\naccurately, giving them a slightly below-average attack\nmodifier of +2.\n• The damage from these attacks should always have an\nimpact when they connect, so we’ll use the impressive\ndamage pool of 3d12+5.\n• Because we want them to feel reckless and powerful, let’s\nmake their Experience a +3 in Throw.\n• The wight wields a massive weapon, so taking a swing\nat multiple targets is a fitting action. The weapon’s\nfrightening nature might have an effect as well, so let’s\nhave it cause PCs to mark a Stress when it hits. We can\nalso play up the wight’s undead nature by saying that\nheavy-hitting attacks against this foe have an unnerving\neffect on the PCs, as they watch the creature’s rotting skin\nsplit open. To make it less overpowered, let’s make the\nfeature cost the wight a Stress.\nA Bruiser adversary with these features might look like this:\nDIRE WIGHT\nTier  Bruiser\nAn undead ogre protective of their territory.\nMotives & Tactics: Kill, obey, protect, terrify\nDifficulty: 15 | Thresholds: 26/42 | HP: 8 | Stress: 4\nATK: +2 | Claws and Teeth: Very Close | 3d12+5 phy\nExperience: Throw +3\nFEATURES\nTerrifying Swing - Action: Spend a Fear to force all targets within\nVery Close range to mark a Stress, then make an attack against\nthem. Targets the Wight succeeds against take 3d10+1 physical\ndamage.\nSplitting Skin - Reaction: When the Wight takes Major or greater\ndamage, you can mark a Stress to force all targets within Very\nClose range to make a Presence Reaction Roll. Targets who fail\nlose a Hope and are knocked back to Close range.\nMINOTAUR WRECKER\nTier  Bruiser\nA massive bull-headed fi rbolg with a quick temper.\nMotives & Tactics: Consume, gore, navigate, overpower, pursue\nDifficulty: 16 | Thresholds: 14/27 | HP: 7 | Stress: 5\nATK: +2 | Battleaxe: Very Close | 2d8+5 phy\nExperience: Navigation +2\nFEATURES\nRamp Up - Passive: You must spend a Fear to spotlight the\nMinotaur. While spotlighted, they can make their standard attack\nagainst all targets within range.\nCharging Bull - Action: Mark a Stress to charge through a group\nwithin Close range and make an attack against all targets in the\nMinotaur’s path. Targets the Minotaur succeeds against take\n2d6+8 physical damage and are knocked back to Very Far range.\nIf a target is knocked into a solid object or another creature, they\ntake an extra 1d6 damage (combine the damage).\nGore - Action: Make an attack against a target within Very Close\nrange, moving the Minotaur into Melee range of them. On a\nsuccess, deal 2d8 direct physical damage.\n198 \tChapter 4: Choosing Adversaries\n\n-- 199 of 415 --\n\nHORDE\nWhether a swarm of rats beneath a tavern or a pack of wolves\nprowling the forest, a Horde represents a massive group of\nenemies in an easy-to-run way.\nMechanics\nHordes are groups of weaker enemies. They deal high damage\ninitially, but less once they’ve marked at least half of their Hit\nPoints (rounded up). Many of them have interesting passives\nor reactions that capture their role in the fiction. Every Horde\nhas the “Horde” passive, which is unique to this adversary\ntype:\nHorde (X) - Passive: When the Horde has marked half or\nmore of their HP, their standard attack deals X damage\ninstead.\nHordes also have a unique notation of (Y/HP) next to their\ntype in their stat block. The Y represents the number of\ncreatures represented by each Hit Point the Horde has. For\nexample, 2/HP means that every Hit Point represents two\nmembers of the Horde. This narrative detail allows you to\nquickly describe the number of foes brought down with each\nattack. For example, if a PC deals 2 Hit Points to the Horde,\nthey take down four enemies with their attack. Hordes work\nwell in theater-of-the-mind play because you only need to use\na single unit in combat to represent many foes.\nArchetypal Example\nWhile every Horde has the same basic mechanics, the Zombie\nPack is a good example of how to capture the fiction with\nthose features. Their damage is near the top of the tier, but\nthey’re less likely to hit with their −1 attack modifier. Since\nthe Horde’s purpose in the narrative is to overwhelm the\ncharacters, it’s fitting that the Zombie Pack has a reaction\ncalled “Overwhelm” that allows them to mark a Stress and\nattack a creature who struck them.\nCustom Hordes\nHordes have low Difficulty and attack modifiers, as well as\naverage damage thresholds. Their damage is initially high, then\ndrops by about half once they’ve taken substantial damage.\nMaking Your Own\nDelving deep into magical mines sometimes exacts a price\nmore permanent than exhaustion. The spirits of miners\nthat perished as a result of their own greed still linger, ever\ncovetous. We’ll make them at Tier 3.\n• Because of their large numbers, the miners are much\neasier to hit. However, they’re also ghostly, so their\nDifficulty might be only slightly lower than average at a 16.\n• We’ll put their thresholds on the low end at Major 15/\nSevere 25, as their ties to the Mortal Realm are tenuous.\nAdditionally, we’ll give them 6 Hit Points and 3 Stress.\n• These miners might have some skill with their tools, but\nthey aren’t trained for combat. At best, they might have a\n+1 attack modifier.\n• As these ghosts once did in life, they exploit any weakness.\nTheir attacks are devastating because of their numbers.\nPutting their standard attack at 3d12+10 means they deal\nhigh damage, which drops to 3d6+5 when they’re at half\nHP or fewer.\n• Trapped by their greed, the miners are obsessed with\ngaining wealth. Giving them a feature that demonstrates\ntheir ravenous hunger against targets with gold plays into\nthe fiction we’ve established.\nA Horde adversary with these traits might look like this:\nCOVETOUS MINERS\nTier  Horde (/HP)\nA ghostly group of miners trapped by their insatiable greed.\nMotives & Tactics: Be free, gain wealth, pay debts\nDifficulty: 16 | Thresholds: 15/25 | HP: 6 | Stress: 3\nATK: +1 | Soul Mattock: Melee | 3d12+10 mag\nFEATURES\nHorde (3d6+5) - Passive: When the Miners have marked half\nor more of their HP, their standard attack deals 3d6+5 magic\ndamage instead.\nHunger for Gold - Action: Mark a Stress to make a standard attack\nwith advantage against all targets carrying gold within\nVery Close range.\nZOMBIE PACK\nTier  Horde (/HP)\nA group of shambling corpses instinctively moving together.\nMotives & Tactics: Consume fl esh, hunger, maul\nDifficulty: 8 | Thresholds: 6/12 | HP: 6 | Stress: 3\nATK: −1 | Bite: Melee | 1d10+2 phy\nFEATURES\nHorde (1d4+2) - Passive: When the Zombies have marked half or\nmore of their HP, their standard attack deals 1d4+2 physical\ndamage instead.\nOverwhelm - Reaction: When the Zombies mark HP from an attack\nwithin Melee range, you can mark a Stress to make a standard\nattack against the attacker.\n199\tChapter 4: Choosing Adversaries\n\n-- 200 of 415 --\n\nLEADER\nA Leader can be the antagonist of the whole campaign or just\nthe current encounter—either way, they’re only as good as\nthe allies who follow them. This adversary could be the boss of\na local thieves’ guild or an evil knight whose army lays waste\nto the countryside. They bring the strength of their forces to\nbear against those who oppose them.\nMechanics\nA Leader can spotlight multiple allies in one move, buff them,\nor summon new combatants to the field, and they create\ndynamic combat by rallying and maneuvering their forces. But\na Leader is also dangerous in their own right—they usually\nhave some of the highest attributes for their tier of play,\nmaking them difficult to hit, harder to take down, and deadly\nwhen they land a blow. When you build an encounter with a\nLeader, the most important thing you can do to sell the fiction\nis to see what types of features they use and pair them with\nother adversaries who take advantage of those features.\nArchetypal Example\nThe Head Guard is an iconic Leader. Their “On My Signal”\nreaction starts a countdown that commands Archer Guards\nto attack with advantage against targets near them. However,\nthis feature doesn’t function when there are no Archer\nGuards present in the scene. When attacking on their own,\na Head Guard generally deals Major damage to Tier 1 PCs,\nbut you can spend 2 Fear to use their “Rally Guards” action,\nspotlighting them and some of their allies to deal more\ndamage. Because the cost for “Rally Guards” is so high,\nhaving enough allies for the Head Guard to take advantage\nof it is paramount. This is true for most Leaders—they need\nsufficient forces to be the greatest threat.\nCustom Leaders\nA Leader should have stats that surpass those of other\nadversaries in the same tier. These adversaries are difficult to\ndefeat because they deal more damage, have higher damage\nthresholds, and have a higher Difficulty. Their main weakness\nis that much of their strength comes from their allies. Take\nthose away and a Leader will struggle.\nMaking Your Own\nWildborne bandit gangs are sometimes led by thieves known\nas Briarwhips. These experienced rangers know the verdant\nwoods and its bounty. When word of well-guarded treasure\nreaches a gang, a Briarwhip is chosen to lead the heist. We’ll\nmake them at Tier 1.\n• They are fierce and nimble rangers, so a Difficulty of 14\nsuits them. You could let them increase their Difficulty,\nsimilar to the Bone domain’s “Ferocity” feature.\n• They wear scale-like stone armor that would give them\nhigher damage thresholds. Let’s do Major 9/Severe 14.\nAdditionally, we’ll give them 6 HP and 4 Stress.\n• They have deadly accuracy with their whip, giving them an\nattack modifier of +3.\n• They attach poisoned thorns to their whip, so their weapon\ndeals more damage, but the application might be less\nconsistent. To represent this, we choose to use 1d10+2 for\ntheir damage.\n• We’ll give them a few Experiences that reflect both their\nLeader type and their background as a ranger.\n• They command their subordinates through the use of hand\nsignals or whistles. Giving them the ability to command\ntheir allies to slink back into the underbrush could be a\ngreat Fear Feature, but consider how that would change\nthe scene. If all their allies are Hidden, the Briarwhip\nwould become the characters’ only target, so we want\nto give them the ability to take the hits headed their way.\nBorrowing from the Bone domain’s “Brace” feature, we\ncan have them mark a Stress to lessen the blow.\nA Leader adversary with these traits might look like this:\nBRIARWHIP\nTier  Leader\nA cunning and capable ranger who takes on the most dangerous\nmissions.\nMotives & Tactics: Explore, plan, protect, steal\nDifficulty: 14 | Thresholds: 9/14 | HP: 6 | Stress: 4\nATK: +3 | Poisoned Briarwhip: Close | 1d10+2 phy\nExperience: Hide +2, Intimidation +2, Track +3\nFEATURES\nFerocious Defense - Passive: When an attack from the Briarwhip\ncauses a target to mark HP, the Briarwhip gains a +1 bonus to\ntheir Difficulty until they mark 1 or more HP.\nInto the Bramble - Action: Spend a Fear to spotlight up to 1d4\nallies within Far range. They move to cover within Close range\nand become Hidden until after their next attack or a PC succeeds\non an Instinct Roll to fi nd them.\nBrace - Reaction: When the Briarwhip marks 1 or more HP, you\ncan mark a Stress to mark 1 fewer HP.\nHEAD GUARD\nTier  Leader\nA seasoned guard with a mace, a whistle, and a bellowing voice.\nMotives & Tactics: Arrest, close gates, pin down, seek glory\nDifficulty: 15 | Thresholds: 7/13 | HP: 7 | Stress: 3\nATK: +4 | Mace: Melee | 1d10+4 phy\nExperience: Commander +2, Local Knowledge +2\nFEATURES\nRally Guards - Action: Spend 2 Fear to spotlight the Head Guard\nand up to 2d4 allies within Far range.\nOn My Signal - Reaction: Countdown (5). When the Head Guard\nis in the spotlight for the fi rst time, activate the countdown. It\nticks down when a PC makes an attack roll. When it triggers,\nall Archer Guards within Far range make a standard attack with\nadvantage against the nearest target within their range. If any\nattacks succeed on the same target, combine their damage.\nMomentum - Reaction: When the Head Guard makes a successful\nattack against a PC, you gain a Fear.\n200 \tChapter 4: Choosing Adversaries\n\n-- 201 of 415 --\n\nMINIONS\nA half-dozen imps tossed away in a single swipe, a room full\nof reanimated skeletons—no matter their form, Minions\nincrease the scale of a battle without bogging down play.\nMechanics\nEach Minion has 1 Hit Point and the following features:\nMinion (X) - Passive: This adversary is defeated when they\ntake any damage. For every X damage a PC deals to this\nadversary, defeat an additional Minion within range the\nattack would succeed against.\nGroup Attack - Action: Spend a Fear to choose a target and\nspotlight all adversaries with this name within a certain range\nof them. Those Minions move into Melee range of the target\nand make one shared attack roll. On a success, they deal X\ndamage each. Combine this damage.\nThe “Minion” passive creates cinematic experiences at the\ntable while ensuring these adversaries are easily defeated.\nEach Minion has a different amount of damage that triggers\ntheir \"Minion” passive, as defined by the number in the\nfeature’s heading. For example, the Giant Rat’s feature says\n“Minion (3),” which means that if an attack deals 3 damage\nto them, the initial target is destroyed, and another Minion\nwithin range who the attack roll would succeed against is also\ndefeated. At 6 damage, two additional Minions within range\nare defeated, and so on. Tell the attacking PC which other\nMinions within range the attack would succeed against and\nlet them choose which Minions they defeat. For example, if a\nPC deals 3 damage to a Giant Rat (Difficulty 10) and there’s\na Rotted Zombie (Difficulty 8) nearby, the PC can choose to\ndefeat the Rotted Zombie in addition to the initial Giant Rat. It’s\nimportant to note that some weapons have greater range than\nothers, making ranged attackers very effective against Minions.\nThe “Group Attack” action allows the Minions to attack using\nonly one roll. This speeds up play significantly, as you simply\nadd up the damage of many attacks rather than rolling for\neach individual attack.\nBecause Minions are so easily defeated, keep the tier of play in\nmind when selecting which adversaries to make Minions—it\nmight be immersion-breaking for a level 1 character to bring\ndown a flight of dragons with one attack.\nArchetypal Example\nThe Giant Rat is an example of a typical Minion. Other than\nthe numbers in their stat blocks, Minions vary little from\nadversary to adversary, as they don’t tend to have other\ndistinguishing features. When Minions do have unique\nfeatures, they should be reserved for cinematic moves that\nmake sense in the fiction (such as the Tangle Bramble Minion’s\n“Drain and Multiply” reaction) or stronger Minions (such as\nthe Hallowed Soldier’s “Divine Flight” passive or the Fallen\nShock Troop’s “Aura of Doom” passive).\nCustom Minions\nIn addition to the previous information, Minions have lower\nDifficulty and do fixed damage.\nMaking Your Own\nThe Demon of Hubris is a Leader who demands perfection\nfrom those beneath them. Who might this sneering king of\nthe Circles Below have as servants to lord over? Idolizing Imps\nthat snivel and bow in deference make perfect sense. We’ll\nmake them at Tier 3.\n• Minions tend to have a low Difficulty for their tier, but\nthese are nimble adversaries, so we’ll give them a\nDifficulty of 17.\n• Because they are Minions, they have 1 HP and 1 Stress.\n• The imps spend their hours idolizing their leader and doing\nlittle else. An attack modifier of +0 feels appropriate.\n• You want Minions to do significant damage at the\nbeginning of a combat, but much less as their numbers\nthin. Let’s do 7 physical damage per Minion.\n• In that case, they’re likely more fragile—we can\nincorporate that into their “Minion” passive so the PCs\nfell many of them in a single blow. “Minion (8)” feels\nappropriate.\nA Minion adversary with these traits might look like this:\nIDOLIZING IMP\nTier  Minion\nA demon who bows in deference to their lord.\nMotives & Tactics: Defend, trick, worship\nDifficulty: 17 | Thresholds: None | HP: 1 | Stress: 1\nATK: +0 | Claws: Melee | 7 phy\nFEATURES\nMinion () - Passive: The Imp is defeated when they take any\ndamage. For every 8 damage a PC deals to the Imp, defeat an\nadditional Minion within range the attack would succeed against.\nGroup Attack - Action: Spend a Fear to choose a target and\nspotlight all Idolizing Imps within Close range of them. Those\nMinions move into Melee range of the target and make one\nshared attack roll. On a success, they deal 7 physical damage\neach. Combine this damage.\nGIANT RAT\nTier  Minion\nA cat-sized rodent skilled at scavenging and survival.\nMotives & Tactics: Burrow, hunger, scavenge, wear down\nDifficulty: 10 | Thresholds: None | HP: 1 | Stress: 1\nATK: −4 | Claws: Melee | 1 phy\nExperience: Keen Senses +3\nFEATURES\nMinion (3) - Passive: The Rat is defeated when they take any\ndamage.

Those\nMinions move into Melee range of the target and make one\nshared attack roll. On a success, they deal 1 physical damage\neach. Combine this damage.\n201\tChapter 4: Choosing Adversaries\n\n-- 202 of 415 --\n\nRANGED\nA Ranged adversary could be a spellcaster firing necrotic bolts\nof energy or an archer on the battlement raining down arrows\non an advancing army. These enemies hit hard while staying\naway from direct conflict.\nMechanics\nBecause of their superior attack range, a Ranged adversary’s\npresence on the battlefield divides the characters’ attention.\nWhen positioning them, spread them out and put other\nthreats between them and the party. Have them use the\nterrain to their advantage when they attack, keeping them\non the edge of their effective range wherever possible. When\nyou build encounters, consider the party’s abilities: Ranged\nadversaries work well against flying characters and can be\ndifficult for melee-focused PCs to deal with.\nArchetypal Example\nA great example of a Ranged adversary is the War Wizard.\nThis enemy doesn’t evoke the traditional idea of a Ranged\nenemy, but they have all the hallmarks of one: They can move\nwithin Far range, they deal lethal damage, and it would take\ntwo hits from most PCs to bring them down. It’s just a matter\nof getting to them.\nCustom Ranged\nThese adversaries have higher than average attack modifiers,\nlower damage thresholds, and fewer Hit Points. They hit hard\nbut go down quickly once engaged.\nMake Your Own\nIn the frozen lands at the top of the world, survival is all that\nmatters. To survive in the most dangerous places, a hunter\nmust have ice in their veins and an unshakable nerve. The\nsettlements in this bitter wasteland depend on these explorers\nto survive—the Icewaste Hunter is a hero to their people.\nWe’ll make them at Tier 2.\n• A longbow would give a PC a −1 to their Evasion. Let’s\nincorporate that into our hunter by giving them an average\nDifficulty of 13.\n• These hardy survivors are keenly attuned to the frozen\nwastes. We can reflect that in their thresholds, Hit Points,\nand Stress by giving them the following stats: thresholds\nof Major 7/Severe 14, 5 Hit Points, and 4 Stress.\n• Hunters bring down dangerous foes from a distance, so\nour Ranged adversary needs a weapon that can hit hard\nfrom far away. We’ll give them a +3 to their attack.\n• They should deal high damage, often Major and\nsometimes Severe. A longbow that deals 2d12+6 damage\nfulfills these requirements.\n• Through years of training, hunters acquire skills that\nhelp them survive and use their surroundings to their\nadvantage. We’ll reflect that in their Experiences.\n• Lastly, we’ll give them a few features that build on these\nExperiences, like taking cover and using traps.\nA Ranged adversary with these traits might look like this:\nICEWASTE HUNTER\nTier  Ranged\nA survivalist who travels the icy wastes in search of dangerous\ngame.\nMotives & Tactics: Hunt, persevere, rescue, track\nDifficulty: 13 | Thresholds: 7/14 | HP: 5 | Stress: 4\nATK: +3 | Longbow: Far | 2d12+6 phy\nExperience: Navigate +2, Survivalist +3\nFEATURES\nSteady Aim - Passive: Mark a Stress to give the Hunter advantage\non their next attack.\nSnowblind Trap - Action: Spend a Fear to target a group within\nClose range. All targets must succeed on an Agility Reaction Roll\nor be caught in the trap, becoming Vulnerable until they escape\nwith a successful Strength or Finesse (14) roll. You gain a Fear\nwhen a target who is caught in this trap makes an action roll.\nTake Cover! - Reaction: Mark a Stress to give an attack against\nthe Hunter disadvantage. If the attack still succeeds, reduce the\nseverity of the damage they take by one threshold.\nWAR WIZARD\nTier  Ranged\nA battle-hardened mage trained in destructive magic.\nMotives & Tactics: Develop new spells, seek power,\nshatter formations\nDifficulty: 16 | Thresholds: 11/23 | HP: 5 | Stress: 6\nATK: +4 | Staff : Far | 2d10+4 mag\nExperience: Magical Knowledge +2, Strategize +2\nFEATURES\nBattle Teleport - Passive: Before or after making a standard attack,\nyou can mark a Stress to teleport to a location within Far range.\nRefresh Warding Sphere - Action: Mark a Stress to refresh the\nWizard’s “Warding Sphere” reaction.\nEruption - Action: Spend a Fear and choose a point within\nFar range. A Very Close area around that point erupts into\nimpassable terrain. All targets within that area must make an\nAgility Reaction Roll (14). Targets who fail take 2d10 physical\ndamage and are thrown out of the area. Targets who succeed\ntake half damage and aren’t moved.\nArcane Artillery - Action: Spend a Fear to unleash a precise hail\nof magical blasts. All targets in the scene must make an Agility\nReaction Roll. Targets who fail take 2d12 magic damage. Targets\nwho succeed take half damage.\nWarding Sphere - Reaction: When the Wizard takes damage from\nan attack within Close range, deal 2d6 magic damage to the\nattacker. This reaction can’t be used again until the Wizard\nrefreshes it with their “Refresh Warding Sphere” action.\n202 \tChapter 4: Choosing Adversaries\n\n-- 203 of 415 --\n\nSKULKS\nSkulks come in different types and have different abilities\nbased on their lore. They can be ambushers who lurk in the\nshadows, skirmishers specializing in hit-and-run tactics, or\nelusive adversaries who confuse the party through mundane\nor magical means.\nMechanics\nA wide breadth of adversaries can fit into the Skulk category,\ntypically those who use misdirection and movement during\ncombat. They might not do damage on every activation,\ninstead opting to hinder the party’s ability to move freely\nthrough the battlefield or debilitate them with a temporary\ncondition. There are several ways to take advantage of these\nadversaries in combat: you might open with an ambush from\na group of Skulks, or a Leader might summon one midway\nthrough the battle, placing them close to PCs who try to\nstay away from the fight. Like Ranged adversaries, most\nSkulks don’t want to stay within Melee range; they strike and\nmove away whenever possible. If you want your Skulks to be\nparticularly cunning, they should ignore warriors, seraphs, and\nguardians, instead pursuing softer targets such as wizards\nand bards.\nArchetypal Example\nThe Jagged Knife Shadow is a good example of a Skulk that\nuses hit-and-run tactics. They can divert attention by using\ntheir “Cloaked” action to become Hidden, then take advantage\nof their “Backstab” passive to increase their damage.\nHowever, they can only use this combo every other turn.\nCustom Skulk\nSkulks have average or higher attack modifiers and Difficulties.\nThey usually deal moderate damage, but they can deal high\ndamage when they attack an isolated or compromised target.\nTheir own damage thresholds are typically in the fragile range.\nMake Your Own\nThe Frostcage Peaks are treacherous at the best of times,\nwhen the sun is high and the ice pack has broken up. The\nwarmth of the day brings out dangerous predators searching\nfor an easy meal. Because of their command of the mountain\ncaves and the chilling skies, Glitterwyrms have become the\napex predators of this space. We’ll make them at Tier 2.\n• They are agile fliers, able to deftly maneuver through the\nfrozen skies despite punishing winds. It makes sense to\nput their Difficulty at 14.\n• As ambush hunters, Glitterwyrms have evolved to secrete\nan oil from their scales that freezes to a mirror-like finish.\nWhile this trait helps them to surprise their prey, they are\nquite fragile. Damage thresholds of Major 9/Severe 18\nwith 5 Hit Points and 4 Stress are appropriate here.\n• These wyrms have keen vision, so a +2 attack modifier\nis appropriate.\n• They approach quietly and dive-bomb into their prey,\nhoping to push them into the icy depths and fish out the\nremains later. Because of this, their bite isn’t as strong as\nother wyrms’ might be—it only deals 2d8+3 damage.\n• Because they’re flying predators with sharp vision, we’ll\ngive them a few Experiences that reflect those traits.\n• The secretion from their tails turns into barbs as they\nhibernate up on the high basalt cliffs that surround the\npassage. We can make an “Icicle Barb” action that allows\nthem to use these as weapons to pin down their prey.\nA Skulk adversary with these traits might look like this:\nGLITTERWYRM\nTier  Skulk\nA wyvern covered in mirror-like scales of ice.\nMotives & Tactics: Ambush, feed, hibernate, hit-and-run\nDifficulty: 14 | Thresholds: 9/18 | HP: 5 | Stress: 4\nATK: +2 | Bite: Very Close | 2d8+3 phy\nExperience: Aerial Predator +2, Keen Vision +3\nFEATURES\nArctic Avian - Passive: While flying, the Glitterwyrm can move up\nto Far range.\nReflective Scales - Passive: Creatures who aren’t within Very Close\nrange of the Glitterwyrm have disadvantage on attacks against\nthem.\nSwift Claws - Action: Mark a Stress to choose a point within\nFar range. The Glitterwyrm moves to that point and makes an\nattack against a target within Very Close range. On a success,\ndeal 2d10+5 physical damage and the target must succeed on a\nStrength Reaction Roll or be knocked back to Close range.\nIcicle Barb - Action: Spend a Fear to make an attack against a\ngroup within Close range. Targets the Glitterwyrm succeeds\nagainst take 2d4 physical damage and become Restrained by the\nbarbs until they break free with a successful Finesse Roll.\nJAGGED KNIFE SHADOW\nTier  Skulk\nA nimble scoundrel bearing a wicked knife and utilizing shadow\nmagic to isolate targets.\nMotives & Tactics: Ambush, conceal, divide, profi t\nDifficulty: 12 | Thresholds: 4/8 | HP: 3 | Stress: 3\nATK: +1 | Daggers: Melee | 1d4+4 phy\nExperience: Intrusion +3\nFEATURES\nBackstab - Passive: When the Shadow succeeds on a standard\nattack that has advantage, they deal 1d6+6 physical damage\ninstead of their standard damage.\nCloaked - Action: Become Hidden until after the Shadow’s next\nattack. Attacks made while Hidden from this feature have\nadvantage.\n203\tChapter 4: Choosing Adversaries\n\n-- 204 of 415 --\n\nSOCIAL\nWhether it’s a meeting with a reticent spy or an interrogation\nof a corrupt leader, not all encounters are solved with\nthe edge of a blade. When the party is faced with a Social\nadversary, they enter a battle of wits.\nMechanics\nWhen planning a social encounter, you should pay particular\nattention to the motives and tactics of these adversaries.\nWhat are the characters trying to get from this encounter?\nWhy would the adversary want to keep this information from\nthem? What would tip the balance and force an adversary’s\nhand? If you have time to establish this NPC prior to their\nintroduction into the story, let their goals and tactics guide the\ninteraction, and give them a memorable quirk to distinguish\nthem in the PCs’ minds.\nArchetypal Example\nA social encounter that many players have experienced\nis haggling with a merchant. These traders are shrewd,\nsqueezing every coin they can out of a deal. The Merchant\nSocial adversary uses their features to fluctuate prices and\ncause characters haggling poorly with them to mark Stress.\nCustom Socials\nWhile their physical stats might be low, Social adversaries\nmight have other means of putting up defenses against the\nparty. These defenses typically come in the form of passive\nfeatures. The adversaries in this book are a good starting point\nfor creating social encounters, but many times you’ll want to\ncreate your own.\nMake Your Own\nA nearby forest settlement is led by elders who have forged a\ngreat connection with nature. In gaining this power, the village\nleaders become an enigma to their people, hidden behind veils\nof shadow. We’ll make them at Tier 1.\n• Their hearts and wills are strong, and they wish only for\nthe good of their people. Let’s give them a Difficulty of 14.\n• Because they aren’t combat-focused, we’ll give them 2 Hit\nPoints. That means they only need a Major threshold, so\nlet’s set that at 6. To reflect their wisdom and patience,\nwe’ll do 4 Stress.\n• Many of these elders hold peace above all else and are\nnot trained in the ways of violence. This would make\ntheir attack modifier a −2.\n• They might carry an old stick or a farm implement\ncovered in vines from the bramble, but everyone knows\nthey’re just for show. A weapon like this would deal 1d4+2\nphysical damage.\n• These elders have lived full lives, expressed by\nhaving several Experiences with larger bonuses. Their\nexperience can show up in their passive, too—they’re\nworld-wise and insightful, so they have advantage in\nthese social situations.\n• The people of these settlements have learned to trust the\nwill of their elders, cryptic as it can sometimes be. We’ll\ncreate an action for social encounters that mechanizes\nthis dynamic called “No Hospitality.” They can also invoke\nthe peace of the meadow in dire situations. This feature\nseems combat-oriented, but it serves a social purpose—\nto showcase the elders’ power, whether used against PCs\nor the elders’ foes. Either way, the “There Will Be Peace”\nreaction is a one-time-use, evocative feature that conveys\ntheir role in their village.\nA Social adversary with these traits might look like this:\nVILLAGE ELDER\nTier  Social\nAn elder of a forest village who can call upon nature magic to provide\nfor their people.\nMotives & Tactics: Care for the community, judge, speak softly,\nuphold tradition\nDifficulty: 14 | Thresholds: 6/None | HP: 2 | Stress: 4\nATK: −2 | Dagger: Melee | 1d4+2 phy\nExperience: History +2, Nature’s Friend +3,\nPillar of the Community +3\nFEATURES\nAge Taught Me Well - Passive: All action rolls to deceive the Elder\nhave disadvantage.\nNo Hospitality - Action: Mark a Stress to forbid any of the Elder’s\nallies from selling or providing comfort to a target or their allies\nfor the next 2d6 days.\nThere Will Be Peace - Reaction: When a creature attacks someone\nwithin the village who the Elder can see, you can spend 2 Fear.\nThat creature must lose all Hope, mark 2d4 Stress, and succeed\non a Presence Reaction Roll (15) or fall Unconscious until 1d4\nhours have passed. While Unconscious, the target can’t make\naction rolls, can’t speak, and automatically fails all reaction rolls.\nOnce the Elder uses this reaction, they can never do so again.\nMERCHANT\nTier  Social\nA fi nely dressed trader with a keen eye for fi nancial gain.\nMotives & Tactics: Buy low and sell high, create demand, inflate\nprices, seek profit\nDifficulty: 12 | Thresholds: 4/8 | HP: 3 | Stress: 3\nATK: −4 | Club: Melee | 1d4+1 phy\nExperience: Shrewd Negotiator +3\nFEATURES\nPreferential Treatment - Passive: A PC who succeeds on a\nPresence Roll against the Merchant gains a discount on\npurchases. A PC who fails on a Presence Roll against the\nMerchant must pay more and has disadvantage on future\nPresence Rolls against the Merchant.\nThe Runaround - Passive: When a PC rolls a 14 or lower\non a Presence Roll made against the Merchant, they\nmust mark a Stress.\n204 \tChapter 4: Choosing Adversaries\n\n-- 205 of 415 --\n\nSOLO\nFrom a terrifying dragon capable of destroying cities to the\nevil that lurks beyond the threshold of the Mortal Realm, these\npowerful adversaries share little in common with each other,\nsave for their purpose: to create an exciting encounter!\nMechanics\nSome Solos have the “Relentless” feature, which allows the\nGM to spotlight them multiple times during a GM turn. Others\nhave multiple reactions that work in place of the “Relentless”\nfeature. Solo adversaries without these features should have\nother units with them or an environment that supports them.\nBecause of the number of features a Solo has, they are more\ncomplex to run.\nArchetypal Example\nWhen looking at the range of Solo adversaries, you might\nhappen across the Juvenile Flickerfly. Their features build on\neach other in a very interesting way. If the flickerfly uses their\n“Mind Dance” action, their “Hallucinatory Breath” reaction\nis even more effective. At Tier 2, their attacks deal moderate\ndamage, but with their “Peerless Accuracy” passive, the\nflickerfly can hit higher-Evasion targets more often. Most\nimportantly, they can take the spotlight up to three times\nduring a GM turn.\nCustom Solos\nThese adversaries might be bosses with loyal lieutenants or\npuzzling encounters the party must work around. They usually\ndeal high damage, have tough defenses, and a large number\nof Hit Points. When an adversary is given the “Relentless”\nfeature, consider how much damage they do with each\nattack—a creature with “Relentless (3)” should usually do less\ndamage on a hit than a creature with “Relentless (2).”\nMake Your Own\nDeep in the ruins of the Earliest Age lies a structure buried\nunder rubble and scorched sand. Within it is a massive forge\ncovered in eldritch invocations. Its crucible brims with energy\nstolen from distant stars. Guarding this forge is an inscrutable\nbeing of twisted metal and flesh. An amalgam of writhing\nlimbs and clicking gears, this Malefacted Giant waits for those\nwho would claim the Starforge. We’ll make them at Tier 2.\n• Given their strange and unpredictable nature, 15 seems\nlike an appropriate Difficulty.\n• This adversary is somewhere between humanoid and\nmachine, giving them solid defenses. Damage thresholds\nof Major 16/Severe 26 with 10 HP and 5 Stress will work\nwell for that purpose.\n• Because of their sheer size and strength, the giant should\nhave a decent attack modifier at +3.\n• Their writhing limbs make for an interesting, evocative\nweapon. Let’s make it deal 2d12+4 physical damage.\n• Instead of having the “Relentless” feature, this adversary\nhas the “Sweeping Dread” reaction, which allows them\nto make multiple attacks on a countdown that ticks down\nas the characters roll with Fear. As this is an aberrant,\neldritch horror, we can lean into the weirdness of their\nbeing with features like “Mindbreaker” and “Behold the\nEnd.” These ramp up the oddity and let you express it in\nthe game, bringing this adversary to life at the table.\n• As the giant fights, they batter the minds of their\nopponents. Giving them a Fear Feature that pierces through\ntheir defenses creates additional tension at the table.\nA Solo adversary with these traits might look like this:\nMALEFACTED GIANT\nTier  Solo\nA giant humanoid made of twisted metal and melted fl esh merged\ntogether in unnatural ways.\nMotives & Tactics: Collect secrets, rend reality, undo fate\nDifficulty: 15 | Thresholds: 16/26 | HP: 10 | Stress: 5\nATK: +3 | Writhing Limbs: Close | 2d12+4 phy\nFEATURES\nBehold the End - Passive: Before a PC would make an action\nroll that would affect the Giant, they must make a Knowledge\nReaction Roll. On a failure, the PC loses a Hope. On a success,\nthe PC is permanently unaffected by this feature.\nScream into the Void - Action: Spend a Fear to unleash a psychic\nscream. All targets within Close range must succeed on a\nPresence Reaction Roll or take 3d10 direct magic damage and\nmark a Stress.\nMindbreaker - Action: Make a standard attack. On a success, mark\na Stress to add a d8 to the damage roll. If the target marks HP\nfrom this attack, they have disadvantage on their next action roll.\nSweeping Dread - Reaction: Countdown (Loop 1d). When\nthe Giant sees a hostile target for the fi rst time, activate the\ncountdown. It ticks down when a PC rolls with Fear. When it\ntriggers, the Giant makes a standard attack against up to three\ntargets within Close range. Targets the Giant succeeds against\nlose a Hope.\nReject Reality - Reaction: When a creature within Far range of the\nGiant critically succeeds on an action roll, the Giant clears all\nStress.\nJUVENILE FLICKERFLY\nTier  Solo\nA horse-sized insect with iridescent scales and crystalline wings\nmoving faster than the eye can see.\nMotives & Tactics: Collect shiny things, hunt, swoop\nDifficulty: 14 | Thresholds: 13/26 | HP: 10 | Stress: 5\nATK: +3 | Wing Slash: Very Close | 2d10+4 phy\nFEATURES\nRelentless (3) - Passive: The Flickerfl y can be spotlighted up to\nthree times per GM turn. Spend Fear as usual to spotlight them.\nPeerless Accuracy - Passive: Before the Flickerfly makes an attack,\nroll a d6. On a result of 4 or higher, the target’s Evasion is halved\nagainst this attack.\nMind Dance - Action: Mark a Stress to create a magically dazzling\ndisplay that grapples the minds of nearby foes. All targets within\nClose range must make an Instinct Reaction Roll. For each target\nwho failed, you gain a Fear and the Flickerfl y learns one of the\ntarget’s fears.\nHallucinatory Breath - Reaction: Countdown (Loop 1d6).\nWhen the Flickerfl y takes damage for the fi rst time, activate\nthe countdown. When it triggers, the Flickerfl y breathes\nhallucinatory gas on all targets in front of them up to Far\nrange. Targets must succeed on an Instinct Reaction Roll or be\ntormented by fearful hallucinations. Targets whose fears are\nknown to the Flickerfly have disadvantage on this roll. Targets\nwho fail must mark a Stress and lose a Hope.\n205\tChapter 4: Choosing Adversaries\n\n-- 206 of 415 --\n\nSTANDARD\nThe town guard, the zombie, the faction agent—Standard\nadversaries represent the average of their peers and are the\nbackbone of any encounter.\nMechanics\nStandard adversaries don’t offer heavy damage or amazing\ndefenses. Instead, they fill out the ranks of a combat. They’re\nbest utilized as a bulwark that prevents the PCs from reaching\ntheir Ranged and Support allies. They might also be a good\nchoice for a Leader to bring into combat to replenish their\nforces. When creating your own adversaries, you might make\nStandard enemies for a faction first, then build the rest of the\nenemies to synergize with their abilities. Standard adversaries\nmight be average, but they don’t need to be boring.\nArchetypal Example\nThe Bladed Guard could be one of the first adversaries your\nparty meets in a campaign. They stand at the gates, protect\nthe townsfolk, and patrol the city’s streets. Their “Shield Wall”\npassive immediately tells you that more of them is always\nbetter, while their “Detain” action conveys their purpose,\nlining up well with their motives and tactics.\nCustom Standards\nMost everything about a Standard adversary is going to be in\nthe average range for the tier. You can use the tables in the\nupcoming “Improvising Adversaries” section to choose the\naverage for their attack modifier and the moderate damage\ndice for their tier. This makes them simple to create. Where\nStandards shine is in the features that define their role in the\nfiction, such as the Bladed Guard’s “Shield Wall,” the Spectral\nGuardian’s “Ghost,” or the Vampire’s “Draining Bite.”\nMake Your Own\nWanderborne communities speak of a legendary troupe that\npops up at a crossroad, luring travelers into a show unlike\nanything they’ve ever seen. Only a rare few return to tell\nthe tale of the Empty Sky Circus. The troupe is filled with\nBladedance Jesters, who constantly move to a song only they\ncan hear. We’ll make them at Tier 4.\n• The jesters are quick and nimble, so to represent this,\nwe’ll give them a Difficulty of 19.\n• They likely wear little armor, so we can do a low Major\nthreshold, and a higher Severe threshold. Major 22/Severe\n50 should work well. The rest of their numbers will be\naverage; we’ll use 5 Hit Points and 3 Stress.\n• Bladedance Jesters are the Empty Sky Circus’s first line\nof defense, more focused on protection than destruction.\nWe’ll give them a +3 attack modifier.\n• We’ll want a weapon that represents them—something\nthat always needs to be in motion or move fluidly to\nattack. Their Chained Chakrams convey that sense of\nmotion and grace and, as a bonus, double as a performing\nprop. We’ll put their attack damage at 4d8+5.\n• To fulfill their role as Standard adversaries, they need to\nbe a plausible threat, which could include interfering with\nthe characters’ movement. To do this, we can have their\nchakrams pull a target closer. We’ll also give the jester a\nreaction to dodge the brunt of some attacks as they move\nto an unheard dance from realms beyond.\nA Standard adversary with these traits might look like this:\nBLADEDANCE JESTER\nTier  Standard\nA lithe circus performer attuned to a dance from realms beyond.\nMotives & Tactics: Channel the dance, entertain, lure away\nDifficulty: 19 | Thresholds: 22/50 | HP: 5 | Stress: 3\nATK: +3 | Chained Chakrams: Very Close | 4d8+5 phy\nExperience: Comedy +2, Dance +3\nFEATURES\nDance With Me - Action: Make an attack against a target within\nVery Close range.

When\nselecting adversaries for an encounter, limit the use of\nSupport adversaries—their defeat should be an important\npart of the tactical calculation. Protect them with Standard\nadversaries and distract PCs with higher-damage targets,\nsuch as a Bruiser or Ranged adversary.\nArchetypal Example\nThe Cult Adept is a great example of what a Support can do.\nThey force targets to mark Stress with their attacks, buff allies\nwith resistance to damage, and restrain their foes. They also\nclear a Stress when a PC rolls a failure with Fear, which plays\ninto their fiction very well.\nCustom Support\nSupports have similar stats to Standards, if not slightly\nweaker. They do low damage and have middling Hit Points.\nAs they usually need to mark Stress to use their actions, they\ntypically have higher Stress than other adversaries.\nMake Your Own\nMany woods are tended to by powerful practitioners of nature\nmagic called Forest Druids. They live in hollowed roots,\npolished caves, or simple thatched huts. We’ll make them\nat Tier 1.\n• We’ll make them slightly easier to hit because they are a\nSupport adversary, granting them a Difficulty of 11.\n• Forest Druids often wear the wood and lichen of the\nforests as armor. Thresholds of Major 6/Severe 10 with\n4 Hit Points and 5 Stress fits their nature.\n• They’re likely to carry standard weapons, so we’ll give\nthem an attack modifier of +0.\n• Similarly, we’ll limit their damage to mostly Minor,\ndealing 1d4+2.\n• These druids seek balance in nature, so an action that\ncan undo the effects of a spell or condition on an ally\nmakes sense. Additionally, the druid could leverage\ntheir understanding of the forest as a living entity, using\nits power to weaken their enemies. Perhaps they also\nsummon the barbs of the wandering briar to stymie\ntheir foes.\nA Support adversary with these traits might look like this:\nFOREST DRUID\nTier  Support\nA reclusive wanderer who understands the speech of beast and leaf.\nMotives & Tactics: Call upon nature, leave no trace, protect the\nwoods at all costs\nDifficulty: 11 | Thresholds: 6/10 | HP: 4 | Stress: 5\nATK: +0 | Oak Staff : Melee | 1d4+2 mag\nExperience: Animal Knowledge +2, Lay of the Land +3\nFEATURES\nCalm of the Vale - Action: Mark a Stress to end the effect of a spell\nor clear any condition affecting the Druid or an ally they can see\nwithin Very Close range.\nDeafening Whisper - Action: Mark a Stress to call on the winds\nin the canopy. A target within Close range must succeed on an\nInstinct Reaction Roll or the whistling wind fi lls their ears. The\ntarget is unable to hear anything besides the wind, must mark a\nStress, and is Vulnerable until they clear a Stress.\nOvergrowth - Action: Spend a Fear and choose a point within Far\nrange. Brambles and thorns erupt from the ground, fi lling an\narea within Close range of that point. A creature who enters\nthat area or tries to move through it takes 2d6+3 physical\ndamage and must succeed on an Agility Reaction Roll or become\nRestrained until they succeed on a Finesse Roll or the Druid takes\nSevere damage.\nCULT ADEPT\nTier  Support\nAn experienced mage wielding shadow and fear.\nMotives & Tactics: Curry favor, hinder foes, uncover knowledge\nDifficulty: 14 | Thresholds: 9/18 | HP: 4 | Stress: 6\nATK: +2 | Rune-Covered Rod: Far | 2d4+3 mag\nExperience: Fallen Lore +2, Rituals +2\nFEATURES\nEnervating Blast - Action: Spend a Fear to make a standard attack\nagainst a target within range.

Or you might\nwant to replace a feature or two, then present them as an entirely different creature. When planning your session (or even mid-\nsession), you can adjust an existing adversary’s stat block to fit the needs of your battle.\nWhen you’re mid-session and you realize you need a new adversary, don’t sweat. You can quickly adjust a stat block to a\ndifferent tier by replacing its existing statistics with those listed on the Improvised Statistics by Tier table, using the column that\ncorresponds to your party’s tier.\nImprovised Statistics by Tier\nAdversary Statistic \tTier 1 \tTier 2 \tTier 3 \tTier 4\nAttack Modifier \t+1 \t+2 \t+3 \t+4\nDamage Dice \t1d6+2 to 1d12+4 \t2d6+3 to 2d12+4 \t3d8+3 to 3d12+5 \t4d8+10 to 4d12+15\nDifficulty \t11 \t14 \t17 \t20\nDamage Thresholds \tMajor 7/Severe 12 \tMajor 10/Severe 20 \tMajor 20/Severe 32 \tMajor 25/Severe 45\nAdjusting Between Tiers\nIf you’re moving an adversary from Tiers 1 or 2 to Tiers 3 or\n4, you’ll want to consider raising their HP and Stress by 1–3\npoints depending on how long you want them to last in the\nbattle and how many Stress-based features they have. Also\nkeep an eye out for features that deal a different amount of\ndamage than the adversary’s standard attack, as those might\nneed some adjustment, as well.\nIf you feel comfortable inventing an adversary’s features on\nthe fly, you can even improvise a completely new adversary\nusing these statistics.\nUsing this guidance won’t always make the adversary a\nperfect match for the PCs at your table, but it’ll reduce the\nchances of you unexpectedly overwhelming the party (or the\nPCs defeating your Solo adversary with just a few rolls).\nAdding or Changing Features\nWhen scaling an adversary to a higher tier, consider adding\na new feature to make them a greater threat instead of just\nscaling up the damage and Difficulty of their existing features.\nSimilarly, if scaling down to a lower tier, consider removing\none of the adversary’s most powerful or impactful features.\nImprovising Hordes, Minions, and Solos\nIf you’re improvising a Horde, Minion, or Solo adversary, keep\nin mind that their power levels are very different from other\nadversaries’. The following guidance can help you create these\nadversaries on the fly:\nHorde: Their standard attack should deal high damage,\nthen reduce (roughly by half) when the Horde has marked\nhalf or more of their HP.\nMinion: Give them a flat damage value for their standard\nattack, usually between 1 and 5, and use that value for their\n“Group Attack” feature. You’ll also set the value of their\n“Minion” feature, determining how much damage is needed\nto defeat additional Minions in one attack. This is usually\nbetween 3 and 15, depending on the adversary’s tier.\nSolo: Give them high damage, high HP, and features that\nlet them act more frequently (like “Relentless”) or deal\narea-of-effect damage.\nDEFEATED ADVERSARIES\nWhen an adversary marks their last Hit Point, they are\ndefeated (unless they have a feature that gives them a second\nchance!), but you and your players decide what this means.\nFor example, the PCs might knock the adversary unconscious,\ntie them up, or kill them. Important adversaries might have\nmeans of cheating or faking death, slipping through the cracks\nto reappear later in the campaign.\n208 \tChapter 4: Choosing Adversaries\n\n-- 209 of 415 --\n\nAdversary Stat Blocks\nThis section contains a list of adversaries by tier, followed by the adversary stat blocks.\nADVERSARIES BY TIER\nThis section contains the following stat blocks:\nTier 1 (Level 1)\nAcid Burrower\nBear\nCave Ogre\nConstruct\nCourtier\nDeeproot Defender\nDire Wolf\nGiant Mosquitoes\nGiant Rat\nGiant Scorpion\nGlass Snake\nHarrier\nArcher Guard\nBladed Guard\nHead Guard\nJagged Knife Bandit\nJagged Knife Hexer\nJagged Knife Kneebreaker\nJagged Knife Lackey\nJagged Knife Lieutenant\nJagged Knife Shadow\nJagged Knife Sniper\nMerchant\nMinor Chaos Elemental\nMinor Fire Elemental\nMinor Demon\nMinor Treant\nGreen Ooze\nTiny Green Ooze\nRed Ooze\nTiny Red Ooze\nPetty Noble\nPirate Captain\nPirate Raiders\nPirate Tough\nSellsword\nSkeleton Archer\nSkeleton Dredge\nSkeleton Knight\nSkeleton Warrior\nSpellblade\nSwarm of Rats\nSylvan Soldier\nTangle Bramble Swarm\nTangle Bramble\nWeaponmaster\nYoung Dryad\nBrawny Zombie\nPatchwork Zombie Hulk\nRotted Zombie\nShambling Zombie\nZombie Pack\nTier 2 (Levels 2–4)\nArcher Squadron\nApprentice Assassin\nAssassin Poisoner\nMaster Assassin\nBattle Box\nChaos Skull\nConscript\nCourtesan\nCult Adept\nCult Fang\nCult Initiate\nDemonic Hound Pack\nElectric Eels\nElite Soldier\nFailed Experiment\nGiant Beastmaster\nGiant Brawler\nGiant Recruit\nGiant Eagle\nGorgon\nJuvenile Flickerfly\nKnight of the Realm\nMasked Thief\nMerchant Baron\nMinotaur Wrecker\nMortal Hunter\nRoyal Advisor\nSecret-Keeper\nShark\nSiren\nSpectral Archer\nSpectral Captain\nSpectral Guardian\nSpy\nStonewraith\nWar Wizard\nTier 3 (Levels 5–7)\nAdult Flickerfly\nDemon of Avarice\nDemon of Despair\nDemon of Hubris\nDemon of Jealousy\nDemon of Wrath\nDire Bat\nDryad\nElemental Spark\nGreater Earth Elemental\nGreater Water Elemental\nHuge Green Ooze\nHydra\nMonarch\nStag Knight\nOak Treant\nTreant Sapling\nHead Vampire\nVampire\nVault Guardian Gaoler\nVault Guardian Sentinel\nVault Guardian Turret\nYoung Ice Dragon\nTier 4 (Levels 8–10)\nArch-Necromancer\nFallen Shock Troop\nFallen Sorcerer\nFallen Warlord:\nRealm-Breaker\nFallen Warlord:\nUndefeated Champion\nHallowed Archer\nHallowed Soldier\nHigh Seraph\nKraken\nOracle of Doom\nOuter Realms Abomination\nOuter Realms Corruptor\nOuter Realms Thrall\nVolcanic Dragon:\nObsidian Predator\nVolcanic Dragon:\nMolten Scourge\nVolcanic Dragon:\nAshen Tyrant\nPerfected Zombie\nZombie Legion\n209\tChapter 4: Adversary Stat Blocks\n\n-- 210 of 415 --\n\nTIER 1 ADVERSARIES (LEVEL 1)\nACID BURROWER\nTier  Solo\nA horse-sized insect with digging claws and acidic blood.\nMotives & Tactics: Burrow, drag away, feed, reposition\nDifficulty: 14 | Thresholds: 8/15 | HP: 8 | Stress: 3\nATK: +3 | Claws: Very Close | 1d12+2 phy\nExperience: Tremor Sense +2\nFEATURES\nRelentless (3) - Passive: The Burrower can be spotlighted up to\nthree times per GM turn.

These stat blocks aren’t restricted to combat—you can\nuse environment stat blocks to enhance any scene, from the\nintrigue of a festive gala to the danger of crumbling ruins.\nEnvironments and adversaries are built to interact with and\nsupport one another, both mechanically and narratively.\nWhile the PCs and adversaries take focus, environments can\nrepresent hazards that originate from the world itself or the\nbackground characters who don’t need entire stat blocks.\nThis section describes how to use each environment’s stat\nblock, and the upcoming “Environment Stat Blocks” section\npresents examples of environments, grouped by tier to\nrepresent their general threat level.\nThe environment framework is meant to be inspiring and\npractical, rather than unchangeable and prescriptive. It\nprovides a way to organize and prepare ideas for important\nscenes. You can customize the environments to fit your game’s\ncharacters and events—for example, you could change the\nImperial Court environment into a Queen’s Birthday Feast\nenvironment, or create a stat block for a Rebel Uprising based\non the Pitched Battle environment features. And if you don’t\nwant to use this adversary-like system for environments, you\ncan ignore these stat blocks entirely—Daggerheart is just as\nenjoyable without them.\nENVIRONMENT BREAKDOWN\nEach environment’s stat block presents the statistics you\nneed to utilize them in play. The following example illustrates\nthis format. Each stat block contains the following elements:\nName\nEach environment stat block has a unique name—in this case,\na Raging River.\nTier\nEach environment is designed to challenge PCs of a certain\ntier. If you use environment stat blocks from other tiers, you\nmight want to adjust their statistics, such as their Difficulty\nand adversaries.\nType\nThe environment’s type appears alongside its tier,\nrepresenting the type of scene it most easily supports. The\nRaging River is a Traversal environment, meaning that the\nthreats and obstacles the PCs encounter there will most likely\nbe physical in nature.\nDescription\nAn evocative one-line summary of the environment.\nImpulses\nEach environment has “impulses,” or the narrative way\nthey push and pull on those within them. Places don’t\nhave volition, but the people and forces that comprise an\nenvironment gravitate toward certain goals and actions (such\nas a river rushing to carry you away or drown you, or a casino\ndisorienting and pushing people to gamble away their money).\nDifficulty\nRaging River has a Difficulty of 10, which provides a baseline\nfor action rolls made to directly oppose the elements of\nthis environment. Individual adversaries appearing in the\nenvironment may have their own Difficulty.\nPotential Adversaries\nMany environments suggest specific adversaries that\ncommonly appear in scenes with that environment. Not every\nlisted adversary needs to appear in an environment, and\nyou’re free to use others instead.\nFeatures\nFeatures provide inspiration for GM moves you can use that\nrepresent the dynamic landscape or situation.\nRAGING RIVER\nTier  Traversal\nA swift-moving river without a bridge crossing, deep enough to\nsweep away most people.\nImpulses: Bar crossing, carry away the unready, divide the land\nDifficulty: 10\nPotential Adversaries: Beasts (Bear, Glass Snake), Jagged\nKnife Bandits (Hexer, Kneebreaker, Lackey, Lieutenant,\nShadow, Sniper)\nFEATURES\nDangerous Crossing - Passive: Crossing the river requires the party\nto complete a Progress Countdown (4).

What travelers\nhave already fallen victim to this predator?\n240 \tChapter 4: Using Environments\n\n-- 241 of 415 --\n\nENVIRONMENT TYPES\nAn environment’s type represents the style of scene it most\nreadily supports, but any kind of interaction can happen in any\nenvironment. Exciting encounters in unexpected environments\ncan provide contrast or round out the narrative. Don’t be\nafraid to plan a social encounter in a dangerous Traversal\nenvironment, or a duel to the death in a Social environment.\nEnvironment types include the following:\n• Explorations are wondrous locations with mysteries and\nmarvels to discover.\n• Socials are locations that primarily present interpersonal\nchallenges.\n• Traversals are dangerous locations where moving around\nthe space itself is a challenge.\n• Events are defined more by the activity taking place than\nthe space they take place in.\nENVIRONMENT FEATURES\nThe bottom of each stat block lists that environment’s features.\nFeature Questions\nBelow each feature, you’ll find italicized questions. These\nquestions are there to inspire plot hooks, provide ideas to fuel\nthe scene, and help connect the scene to other story elements.\nFor example, the Raging River’s “Undertow” feature asks,\n“What trinkets and baubles lie along the bottom of the riverbed?\nDo predators swim these rivers?” These questions invite you\nto consider who or what has been here before, what their\npresence has left behind, as well as what predators might take\nadvantage of the powerful undertow for their own benefit.\nUsing Features\nWhen you make a GM move, you can use environment\nfeatures like you would adversary features. Environment\nfeatures can take the form of actions (which can be used as\nyour GM move), reactions (which happen freely in response to\na trigger), and passives (which automatically apply).\nFear Features\nLike adversaries, environments can have Fear Features—\npowerful, scene-defining effects that require spending Fear\nto activate. Most environment Fear Features take the form of\nactions, such as the following example:\nTunneling Terror - Action\nSpend a Fear to summon an Acid Burrower, who bursts\nup from the ground where they have been waiting for prey.\nThe Acid Burrower takes the spotlight to use their “Earth\nEruption” action.\nNot every environment has a Fear Feature—we recommend\nreserving them for when they’re most impactful.\n241\tChapter 4: Using Environments\n\n-- 242 of 415 --\n\nADAPTING ENVIRONMENTS\nSometimes you want to use an environment but it’s at the wrong tier for your party. Or you might want to replace a feature or\ntwo, then present it as an entirely different environment. Whether planning your session or even improvising an environment\nmid-session, you can adjust an existing environment’s stat block to fit the needs of your scene or improvise elements as needed.\nThe environments framework is there to help organize ideas, not to stifle creativity.\nWhen you need to quickly adjust a stat block to a different tier, you can simply replace its existing statistics with those listed on\nthe Environment Statistics by Tier table, using the column that corresponds to your party’s tier.\nEnvironment Statistics by Tier\nEnvironment Statistic \tTier 1 \tTier 2 \tTier 3 \tTier 4\nDamage Dice \t1d6+1 to 1d8+3 \t2d6+3 to 2d10+2 \t3d8+3 to 3d10+1 \t4d8+3 to 4d10+10\nDifficulty \t11 \t14 \t17 \t20\nScaling Environments\nEnvironments are easier to scale than adversaries, since they\ndon’t have Hit Points, damage thresholds, or Stress. You’ll\nwant to adjust the default Difficulty, any Difficulties listed in\nfeatures, and the damage dealt by features. If the environment\nhas a feature that involves summoning an adversary, consider\nreplacing the listed adversaries with ones appropriate to the\nparty’s tier or or scaling down the listed adversaries.\nAdding or Changing Features\nWhen scaling an environment to a higher tier, consider adding\na Fear Feature if there isn’t one already. Similarly, if scaling\ndown to a lower tier, consider removing the most powerful or\nimpactful feature.\nEnvironment Stat Blocks\nThis section contains a list of environments by tier, followed by the environment stat blocks (see the earlier\n“Using Environments” section for environment rules).\nENVIRONMENTS BY TIER\nThis section contains the following stat blocks.\nTier 1 (Level 1)\nAbandoned Grove (Exploration)\nAmbushed (Event)\nAmbushers (Event)\nBustling Marketplace (Social)\nCliffside Ascent (Traversal)\nLocal Tavern (Social)\nOutpost Town (Social)\nRaging River (Traversal)\nTier 2 (Levels 2–4)\nCult Ritual (Event)\nHallowed Temple (Social)\nHaunted City (Exploration)\nMountain Pass (Traversal)\nTier 3 (Levels 5–7)\nBurning Heart of the Woods\n(Exploration)\nCastle Siege (Event)\nPitched Battle (Event)\nTier 4 (Levels 8–10)\nChaos Realm (Traversal)\nDivine Usurpation (Event)\nImperial Court (Social)\nNecromancer’s Ossuary\n(Exploration)\n242 \tChapter 4: Enviroment Stat Blocks\n\n-- 243 of 415 --\n\nTIER 1 ENVIRONMENTS (LEVEL 1)\nABANDONED GROVE\nTier  Exploration\nA former druidic grove lying fallow and fully reclaimed by nature.\nImpulses: Draw in the curious, echo the past\nDifficulty: 11\nPotential Adversaries: Beasts (Bear, Dire Wolf, Glass Snake),\nGrove Guardians (Minor Treant, Sylvan Soldier, Young Dryad)\nFEATURES\nOvergrown Battlefield - Passive: There has been a battle here.

You can choose one of\nthe campaign frames from the following pages or use their\nstructure to inspire your own.\nEvery campaign frame has a complexity rating that indicates\nhow challenging the campaign is to run. Campaign frames\nwith a lower complexity rating often sit squarely within the\nkind of genre Daggerheart is built for and don’t have many\nadditional mechanics to consider. Campaign frames with a\nhigher complexity rating often push the genre of the campaign\noutside the bounds of traditional fantasy, contain more\nin-depth mechanics to implement, and require a GM who is\ncomfortable creating new game elements (often known as\n“homebrewing”)—such as stat blocks, equipment, and similar\ncontent—for their players.\nEach campaign frame includes the following sections.\n• A pitch to present to players\n• Suggestions for the campaign’s tone, feel, themes, and\ncultural touchstones that helped shaped it\n• An overview of the campaign’s background\n• Guidance for how certain communities, ancestries, and\nclasses fit into the setting\n• Principles for players and GMs to consider during the\ncampaign\n• Unique setting distinctions\n• An inciting incident to launch the campaign\n• Special mechanics to use during the campaign\n• Questions to consider during session zero\nYou can find each campaign frame map in the appendix or at\nwww.daggerheart.com/downloads.\nCampaign Frame Breakdown\nThe following steps highlight the important parts of a campaign frame and describe how to use a frame to start a new campaign.\nSTEP 1:\nPITCH THE CAMPAIGN\nUse the pitch to give your players a brief idea of what the\ncampaign will be like. You can also pull from the touchstones\nsection (eliminating or adding your own as you’d like) and\nshare the tone & feel and themes. Answer any question they\nmight have and ensure they are interested in the campaign.\nSTEP 2:\nPROVIDE THE FOUNDATIONS\nOnce the players are onboard, give them the overview and\nplayer principles. You may also choose to read them your\nGM principles. Additionally, provide them any information\nfrom distinctions you think might be relevant, as well as any\ncampaign mechanics they should know.\nSTEP 3:\nGUIDE THEIR CHARACTERS\nAs they are brainstorming what kind of characters they\nwant to make, you can share the information from the\ncommunities, ancestries, and class sections as applicable.\nThese can be overwhelming to engage with all at once, so as\nthey become relevant, discuss as needed with your players.\nSTEP 4:\nBUILD THE MAP\nOnce players have made their characters, pass a copy of the\ncampaign frame map around the table, adding locations to it\ncollectively from either the available list or your imaginations.\nFollow the rest of the Session Zero prep as usual.\nSTEP 5:\nRUN A SESSION ZERO\nChoose any of the session zero questions from the campaign\nframe to ask your players.\nSTEP 6:\nBEGIN THE ADVENTURE\nFinally, use the provided inciting incident—or write your\nown—to start the campaign!\nEach campaign frame in the following section is written by\na unique team of writers and is specialized to the needs of\nthe campaign it facilitates. Because of this, their style, voice,\ncomplexity, and approach vary more than other sections of\nthis book. Use these frames as inspiration when developing\nyour own campaign. We don’t want you to be hemmed in by a\nstrict template, so expand upon the pieces that work for your\ntable and let the rest fall away.\n253\tChapter 5: Campaign Frames\n\n-- 254 of 415 --\n\nTHE WITHERWILD\nWhen an invading nation attacks an ancient forest deity, a virulent overgrowth spreads\nthroughout the land.\nDesigned by Carlos Cisco, Rowan Hall, & Spenser Starke\nComplexity Rating: •\nTHE PITCH\nRead this section to your players to introduce them to the\ncampaign.\nFanewick was once a place of great abundance and peace—\ndangerous to those unfamiliar with the land, but a cornucopia\nto those who respected its ways. When Haven invaded the\nwilds and forced the land into eternal spring, a dangerous\nbloom known as the Witherwild took hold and now threatens\nthe lives of all who live there. In a Witherwild campaign,\nyou’ll play unlikely heroes from humble beginnings who are\nreckoning with their newfound duty to save Fanewick’s people\nfrom dangerous corruption.\nTONE & FEEL\nAdventurous, Dynamic, Epic, Heroic, Thrilling,\nUncanny, Whimsical\nTHEMES\nCultural Clash, Ends Justify Means, Grief, People vs.\nNature, Transformation and Change, Survival\nTOUCHSTONES\nPrincess Mononoke, The Legend of Zelda, The Dark Crystal,\nNausicaä of the Valley of the Wind\n254 \tChapter 5: The Witherwild\n\n-- 255 of 415 --\n\nOVERVIEW\nIf your group decides to play this campaign, give your players the following information before character creation.\nFanewick is a wild and untamed land, long avoided by outside\nforces. The woods are dark and twisting, filled with Faint\nDivinities who perform small miracles and services for its\ninhabitants, but are just as likely to lure travelers off narrow\npaths to their ruin. Seemingly harmless expanses of field hide\nbogs that engulf entire armies, consuming heavy artillery as\nquickly as it can cross the border. This wilderness fosters\nhardy people who are bold enough to raise families where\nothers have not and strictly follow the unique rules that keep\nthem safe. These Wicklings remained insulated from their\nneighbors’ wars until plague forced the people of Haven to\ndesperate acts.\nHaven was once the most powerful force in the region; for\ncenturies, the high stone walls into the capital bore the phrase\n“The Godless Gate.” While the original meaning has been\nlost to common knowledge, some dusty tomes and ancient\nrecords state that the founders of Haven wished to be free\nof the influence of the Faint Divinities that dominated the\nsurrounding regions. They hatched a plan to kill one of the\nmightiest of these deities, known as Shun’Aush the Granite\nOphid. While their exact method of deicide is forgotten, their\nvictory ensured Haven’s dominance in the region for centuries\nto come. They made their home behind his remains, which\nbecame the mighty walls that Haven is known for.\nBut Shun’Aush would have his revenge. As the Havenites\ncarved through his stone body, the fine dust left behind\nsettled into the surrounding earth. There was a time of\nprosperity over many centuries while the scales of the god\nremained undisturbed. But progress is its own pressure. The\ngrowing population demanded increased productivity, and\nas farmers tilled deeper soil and miners hacked into hidden\nstone, the ancient stone dust rose to the surface. The same\nwalls that brought the city security became the crucible that\nincubated a virulent plague.\nOver the last two years, over half of Haven’s populace fell to a\ndisease known as the Serpent’s Sickness. First, victims cough\nup dust. Soon after, their skin breaks out in a scaling rash.\nFinally, their body hardens—first the flesh, bones, and soft\ntissue, spreading until, finally, their organs ossify. Once within\nthe organs, “the serpent” moves so quickly that sufferers\npetrify where they stand, filling Haven with statues of victims\nin their last moments of agony.\nThe High Magus of Haven, Archmage Phylax, discovered a\nrare red flower called the crimson lady’s veil that could cure\nthe Serpent’s Sickness. These buds grow prolifically across\nFanewick in the spring—but for every ten thousand of the\ncommon white-petaled blossoms, only one red flower blooms.\nDesperate to save their people from the plague, Haven\ninvaded Fanewick to amass the scarce red buds. Their forces\nplunged into the deep wood and, under the guidance of\nArchmage Phylax, plucked out the Reaping Eye from the most\npowerful Faint Divinity that protected the land: The Great\nOwl Nikta, the Shepherd of the Seasons. The Shepherd kept\nFanewick in balance by turning her eyes upon the land, first\nfor ripening, then ruination. Thus Nikta maintained the cycle\nof seasons—of growth and decay, of death and rebirth. With\nher Reaping Eye removed, Nikta can only watch over Fanewick\nwith the Sowing Eye, forcing the land into everlasting spring.\nIn the year since, Haven has conquered the bogs, turning them\ninto fields to harvest red flowers. The endless growth that\nonce seemed like a gift quickly evolved into a scourge known\nas the Witherwild—Fanewick’s flora and fauna flourished,\nunchecked and uncontrolled. Animals swell to massive size;\ntrees warp, twist, and begin to hunt people; and vines creep\nalong the forest floor, strangling all they touch. This explosive\ngrowth is unconquerable and unrelenting, with no force able\nto stop the burgeoning verdance for long.\nPrior to the Serpent’s Sickness and the Shepherd’s endless\ngrowth, your party lived a peaceful life in Fanewick or a life of\ntoil and conquest in Haven. But when the danger demands a\nresponse, even the unprepared—and unwilling—must make\na stand.\nTHE WITHERWILD\n255\tChapter 5: The Witherwild\n\n-- 256 of 415 --\n\nCOMMUNITIES\nAll communities are available, but some have unique aspects within a Witherwild campaign. As needed, provide the following\ninformation to your players and choose one or more of the questions to ask them during your session zero.\nLoreborne and Highborne\nIn Fanewick, knowledge is the most valuable commodity, and\nthose who have expertise have the most power. This economy\nof information functions primarily through gifting and trading,\nand wisdom would be considered acceptable collateral for\na weapon or warm meal. As such, loreborne community\nmembers are the wealthiest in Fanewick and might be smaller,\ndistinct groups of hunters, historians, or artisans within larger\nvillages.\n• What knowledge did your community teach you that you\nmust now protect or share?\n• What are you able to accomplish because of your\nupbringing that others outside your community do not\nunderstand?\n• You once traded important knowledge for something\nterrible. What did you impart and what did you gain in\nreturn?\nIn Haven, the wealthiest members are highborne, having\ninherited riches built in the walled city over generations.\nWhile the highborne of Haven were more insulated from the\nSerpent’s Sickness, none were immune.\n• Who have you lost to the Serpent’s Sickness? How did it\naffect you?\n• How did your family make their wealth? Have you rejected\nor embraced their core set of ethics?\n• You grew up in a world of abundance but were kept\nfrom learning something about the world. What was this\nknowledge and when did you discover it?\nRidgeborne, Underborne, and Wildborne\nCharacters from these communities were likely raised in\nFanewick’s deadly environs, which have only become more\ndangerous as the Witherwild grows. Each community has\nunique customs, some freely shared and others kept secret,\nthat allow them safe passage through dangerous terrain and\nthe Faint Divinities’ territories.\nIn exchange for protection from the Witherwild for themselves\nand their families, some Wicklings from these groups have\nbeen forced to take jobs as farmers in Haven’s flower fields.\nThough it is backbreaking work performed for a nation\ndestroying their land, the farmers are offered safety by the\nHaven fires that burn back the ever-creeping Witherwild.\n• What Faint Divinities do you give tribute to, and how have\nyou been rewarded in kind?\n• You displeased a god of Fanewick. What did you do, and\nwhat misfortune befell you or a loved one?\n• You fled the place of your birth. What circumstances drove\nyou to leave?\nOrderborne\nPlayers might choose to build orderborne characters if they\nwant to play current or former members of the Haven Army\nthat invaded Fanewick. Though the army brings violence into\nthis land, they also carry overwhelming grief for a homeland\nsuccumbing to disease.\n• What regrets do you carry with you from your conquest of\nforeign soil?\n• What kindness did an enemy combatant bestow upon you\nin an hour of need? How did this change your view of the\npeople of Fanewick?\n• You were charged with planting a rumor in a Fanewick\ncommunity. What is the rumor, and do you plan to carry\nout this mission?\nSlyborne\nAs the Haven Army is the current martial power in Fanewick,\nthose who wish to play slyborne characters might come\nfrom Fanewick rebel groups seeking to expel the invading\nforces from their lands. Depending on the tactics their group\nemploys, a character from a slyborne community might align\nwith or go against their upbringing.\n• Who among the Haven Army do you wish to exact revenge\nupon and why?\n• You joined an insurgent group working to free this land\nfrom Haven’s grasp. What has given you doubts about the\nleadership’s methods?\n• Someone you love is a member of the Haven Army. How\nhave you used your position in the rebellion to protect\nthem?\nTHE WITHERWILD\n256 \tChapter 5: The Witherwild\n\n-- 257 of 415 --\n\nSeaborne\nBoth Fanewick and Haven have a coastal border. The majority\nof Fanewick’s seaborne communities live in small seaside\ngroups and focus on local travel to neighboring regions, while\nHavenites tend to live in large ports that ship and receive\ngoods from distant lands.\n• You recently traveled by sea over a vast distance. What\nwent terribly wrong on that passage, and how has it\nchanged you?\n• Growing up on the sea taught you a skill few have. What\ndid you learn, and how did it save your life?\n• You used to sail with a companion. Who were they, and\nhow do you remain connected?\nWanderborne\nWanderborne communities can be found in both Fanewick and\nHaven, though safe travel has been severely restricted due to\nthe military occupation and the expansion of the Witherwild.\nWhether a wanderborne character comes from Fanewick,\nHaven, or elsewhere, the player should determine their\ncharacter’s personal views on the invasion of Fanewick, and\nhow that aligns or departs from their community’s views.\n• What do you do to keep your small community safe,\nindependent, and hidden from Haven’s forces?\n• Because of your community’s transience, you have loved\nones in both Fanewick and Haven. How has this affected\nyour relationship with the invasion?\n• Your community travels to protect something. What is it,\nand why does it keep you from settling down?\nANCESTRIES\nAll ancestries are available, but some have unique aspects within a Witherwild campaign. As needed, provide the following\ninformation to your players.\nClanks\nClanks from Haven are commonly made from iron and steel,\nwhile clanks from Fanewick are typically constructed from\nwood and stone.\nFungril\nSince the Witherwild spread throughout Fanewick, some\nfungril inhabiting the forests have grown noticeably larger than\nfungril from other regions.\nDrakona, Fauns, Firbolgs, and Infernis\nAfter the Witherwild corrupted Fanewick, some drakona,\nfauns, firbolgs, and infernis have noticed their horns growing\nfaster and longer.\nGalapa and Ribbets\nMany families of galapa and ribbets who lived in the bogs of\nFanewick were displaced when Haven’s army invaded.\nHavenites and the Serpent’s Sickness\nAnyone, but especially those from Haven, may carry the\nSerpent’s Sickness, which stiffens their movements and gives\nthem limited time to survive without a cure.\nCLASSES\nAll classes are available, but some have unique aspects within a Witherwild campaign. As needed, provide the following\ninformation to your players.\nDruids, Rangers, and Sorcerers\nDruids, rangers, and sorcerers are commonly found\nthroughout Fanewick. If players choose one of these classes,\nthey should consider how their character’s connection to the\nnatural world might be impacted by the Witherwild.\nWarriors and Wizards\nWarriors and wizards are prevalent in Haven. A large wizarding\nschool in Haven teaches fighters and healers, and the Haven\nArmy is largely composed of warriors and School of War\nwizards. If a PC is either of these classes, consider their\npersonal relationship to the Haven Army.\nVengeance Guardian\nMany Wicklings who seek revenge on Haven or to expel them\nfrom Fanewick become Vengeance guardians. If players\nchoose this subclass, they should consider what ideals or\ninstitutions their character protects.\nSyndicate Rogue\nThe Haven Army sends spies into Fanewick communities to\ngain information on planned attacks and manipulate public\nperception. When selecting the Syndicate rogue subclass,\nplayers should consider how their character might be\nconnected to or impacted by these covert operatives.\nTHE WITHERWILD\n257\tChapter 5: The Witherwild\n\n-- 258 of 415 --\n\nPLAYER PRINCIPLES\nIf your group decides to play this campaign, give your players\nthe following information before character creation.\nMake the Invasion Personal\nConsider how Haven’s invasion of Fanewick deeply impacts\nyour character. Let these details inform what they want and\nwhat they’re willing to do to get it. Everyone has lost a loved\none to the Witherwild or the Serpent’s Sickness, and more\nare dying by the day. Consider how the growing conflict\ncaused your character to act in ways they aren’t proud of,\nor transformed personal truths they once believed were\nunshakable.\nTreat Death with Importance\nTaking a life should not be done without consideration,\ndesperation, and consequences. As your character journeys,\nthey should remember those they’ve lost and those they’ve\nslain, allowing each death to affect their choices in the future.\nEmbrace Vulnerability\nFind your character’s humanity and showcase it whenever you\ncan. They should be as vulnerable during quiet moments as\nthey are vicious during violent ones, opening up to their allies\neven if they close themself off to everyone else.\nGM PRINCIPLES\nKeep the following guidance in mind while you GM this\ncampaign.\nPaint the World in Contrast\nSubvert expectations by giving space for the nightmarish to\ncharm and the beautiful to terrify. Give the PCs visions of the\nnatural beauty of Fanewick that has run roughshod across\nthe region, breaking the bounds of the bogs and forests and\ndevastating homes and communities. Show the grim and\nordered life behind Haven’s walls, but also show the culture,\nart, and progress that has come out of centuries of safety.\nContrast the capricious nature of the Faint Divinities with\nthe devotion of the Wicklings and Havenites fighting to save\ntheir home. In a place of long nights and days, dual seasons,\nand two nations in conflict, look for ways to highlight bold\ndualities.\nShow Them True Danger\nThough it may be tragic, bodily harm is not the worst tragedy\nthat can befall the characters. To illustrate what’s truly at\nstake, use the PCs’ origins in Fanewick or Haven to show them\nwhat they stand to lose, be it their homes, family, friends,\ncommunities, or even their core truths and beliefs. The events\nof this campaign may change, threaten, or destroy these\naspects of their past—when your players create and are\ninvested in their character’s backstory, they have something\nto fight for.\nOffer Alternatives to Violence\nBy illuminating nonviolent approaches to problem-solving, the\nPCs can help break the brutal cycle that binds this world. For\nexample, showing compassion—rather than swordpoint—\nto a corrupted beast can free them from the Witherwild.\nSimilarly, the conflict between Haven and Fanewick shouldn’t\nonly be solved with blood and blade. What threatens both\ncould also unify them. Give the PCs opportunities to mend old\nwounds, right past wrongs, and heal the rift between Haven\nand Fanewick from within.\nCreate Multidimensional Allies and Adversaries\nNo adversary or ally is all good or all bad, and they each have\nmultidimensional lives. Even the most congenial ally should\nbe hiding darkness inside them, hoping their failings will go\nundiscovered. Those painted as evil should sometimes do the\nright thing, even if it’s for the wrong reason. Just because a\nPC or NPC is from Haven doesn’t make them a villain, and,\nconversely, not all the inhabitants of Fanewick are virtuous.\nFinding the nuance, complications, and deeper motivations\nof the people of Haven and Fanewick will lead to richer\ninteractions, more complex moral choices, and a deeper sense\nof attachment to the world for the players.\nTHE WITHERWILD\n258 \tChapter 5: The Witherwild\n\n-- 259 of 415 --\n\nDISTINCTIONS\nUse this information to prepare your campaign. You can also\nshare it with your players as needed.\nThe Weeks of Day and Night\nThe day and night cycle occurs weekly, meaning the sun rises\nfor an entire week before setting into a nighttime of the same\nlength. This has an impact on everything from agriculture to\ntrade, as many merchants refuse to travel through the night.\nBut this cycle doesn’t just affect Wicklings, it’s dictated how\nFanewick’s wondrous ecology has evolved. Days and nights\nare accompanied by entirely different natural soundscapes\nas Fanewick’s nocturnal denizens sleep through the long days\nand stalk the woods in times of darkness while their diurnal\ncounterparts sleep. The plants similarly live on this strange\nday-night loop, and many live out their entire life cycles in a\nweek. Sun rose vines make a thorny ascent to the top of the\ntree canopy over the course of the week, only to wilt under the\nlight of the moon. Conversely, night bloom, a bioluminescent\nflower that emits the smell of burnt sugar and decay,\nonly blossoms when evening falls, illuminating patches of\nforest—a godsend to anyone forced to travel in the dark.\nThe Serpent’s Sickness\nThe plague sweeping across Haven spares no one. Since\nthe initial outbreak, Haven officials have worked tirelessly to\nquarantine those in the early stages of the disease, but this\neffort has done little to stop its spread. Due to the rarity of\ncrimson lady’s veil, many citizens began to carry or consume\nall manner of flowers and snake sheddings in an attempt to\nprotect or cure themselves.\nIn the initial stages, victims are afflicted with a hacking cough\nladen with dust that resembles powdered bone. Then a scaled\nrash erupts across their skin, cracking their flesh in a unique\nand painful pattern that resembles a snake’s skin. Not long\nafter, the victims’ bodies harden until their organs solidify and\ncease to function. The final stages of the Serpent’s Sickness is\nso quick that many transform into statues where they stand,\nleaving all of Haven a cenotaph to a once-great power.\nLady’s Veil\nThese small flowers grow in patches of sun throughout\nFanewick. For every ten thousand blossoms of white-petaled\nflowers, one blooms a unique and vibrant red. These flowers\nhave long been used in herbal teas across the region, with the\ncrimson flowers holding a place in specific ceremonies. Even\nso, they were only foraged until the Havenites discovered\ncrimson lady’s veil—the only known cure for Serpent’s\nSickness.\nThus, the Haven Army invaded Fanewick and began cultivating\nthe flowers on massive farms that have overtaken the region’s\nbogs. Though the theft of the Reaping Eye has created an\nindefinite growing season, the red flowers remain just as rare,\nand Fanewick is permeated by a sickly sweet smell as the\nHaven Army races to mass-produce a cure for the Serpent’s\nSickness.\nTHE WITHERWILD\n259\tChapter 5: The Witherwild\n\n-- 260 of 415 --\n\nThe Witherwild\nThis corruption, empowered by the endless spring, is\nspreading throughout Fanewick. Some believe the overgrowth\nbegan in the forest, while others claim it sprang from the\nbogs. But no matter its origins, this flourishing malignancy\ninduces horrific changes and massive growth on anything\nit touches, transforming them into Withered beings. Plants\nspring to life with a desire to consume all around them.\nAnimals grow to immense proportions, with onerous\ndispositions to match their exaggerated teeth, tusks, and\nclaws. Even harmless creatures that were once hunted for\nfood have become dangerous and formidable adversaries.\nWhen a person is corrupted by the Witherwild, either from\na purposeful attack or accidental harm (see the upcoming\n“Corruption from the Witherwild” section), they are\ntransformed. They become a nightmarish hybrid—their body\nwarped and intertwined with plant or beast. The Witherwild\nslowly replaces the personality of its victims with the same\ndrive to consume exhibited by the rest of the corrupted\nFanewick. Though the Withered may retain a semblance of\nwho they are for a time, they eventually face the final loss of\ntheir personhood. Some Wicklings believe the Withered are\ngifted this power by Nikta’s wrath to drive the forces of Haven\nfrom Fanewick and return the Shepherd’s Reaping Eye.\nThe Gods of Fanewick\nGods in this land aren’t ethereal concepts that exist in another\nrealm; instead, they wander the land as incarnate beings,\nresiding in both the natural world as well as within homes and\nsmall villages. As such, they’re generally present in Wicklings’\nlives. Many communities, and some larger families, even have\ntheir own small god or tutelary spirit who watches over them.\nBelief and worship take on a different meaning in Fanewick—\nthere is a constant push and pull between the goals of people\nand their deific neighbors. The gods must curry worship from\nmortals, often by performing small miracles, acts of service,\nor by testing their resolve with tricks and curses. Mortals\nrely on the small blessings from the gods to keep them safe\nwhen traveling and working in Fanewick. The most powerful\nand widely acknowledged Faint Divinity is the Shepherd of\nSeasons, Nikta, as the loss of her eye had the most recent and\nvisible impact on everyone in Fanewick.\nFanewick’s various divinities each have their own opinion\nconcerning the Witherwild corruption. While some enjoy\nnature’s newfound dominance, many of the lesser deities are\nwary of how out of balance Fanewick has become. While their\nbehavior and motives may be inscrutable, these deities are\nmore accessible than gods who watch from on high.\nFulg, Stacker of Stones: A small god who favors tribute in\nthe form of smooth, stacked river rocks. Under his power,\nbivalves and limpets grow abundantly on rocks where they\ncan be easily harvested. He is largely uninformed about the\nproblems Fanewick faces, and he prefers it that way.\nHyacynis, They Who Spread Small Blossoms: A friend of\nbees and tiny flowers who has embraced the Witherwild\nafter seeing their influence and domain swell (literally)\nto immense proportions. They’re enjoying this rampant\ngrowth and do not see a reason to end it.\nIkla, the Sky Painter: Ikla’s artistic prowess and talent are\nunmatched, painting the skies of each weekly sunrise and\nsunset over Fanewick in a myriad of scintillating colors.\nThey could not be lazier the rest of the week, and their\ndemeanor is exceedingly unpleasant, offended that anyone\nwould ask a favor of them during their time off.\nOove, the Watcher of the Night Bloom: He is one of the\nfew local gods who has never been seen, but he is often\nheard in the wilds at night, whispering directions to lost\ntravelers, pointing them to the nearest source of night\nbloom. Locals claim he leads those who displease him\nor harm nocturnal creatures into dangerous terrain. It’s\nrumored that he watches over Fanewick nights from his\nhome on the moon.\nQui’Gar, Whispered Sweetness for a Thorny End: A quiet\ngod who presides over the deaths of those who pass in\nthorny bushes and briar patches. Traditionally, she doesn’t\nreceive many visitors, but the Witherwild’s corruptive\ngrowth has made her job harder and upended her quiet\nexistence.\nRohkin, the Wandering Horn: Rohkin watches over the\nmany herds of horned creatures that reside in Fanewick.\nIn happier times, he preserved the balance of nature\nand civilization, preventing overhunting. But since the\ncorruption of the Witherwild has taken hold, he’s seen his\nherds change into unrecognizable, dangerous beasts.\nThese are but a small slice of the hundreds, if not thousands,\nof Faint Divinities lurking, relaxing, hunting, and playing\nthroughout Fanewick.\n• What Faint Divinities do the PCs acknowledge and pay\ntribute to, if any?\n• How has the Witherwild changed the outlook, personality,\nand dispositions of the Faint Divinities the characters\nencounter?\n• Which gods ally themselves with Haven to preserve the\nendless spring? Which align with Fanewick?\nTHE WITHERWILD\n260 \tChapter 5: The Witherwild\n\n-- 261 of 415 --\n\nTHE INCITING INCIDENT\nYou can use the prompt below to start your campaign, or\ncreate your own.\nThe Reaping Eye is stowed in a secure vault beneath the\ncentral tower of Haven’s wizarding school, seemingly\nimpossible to recover. A secretive and dangerous rebel group,\nled by a mysterious figure known only as the Fanewraith\n(she/her), has hatched a plan to end the curse of the\nWitherwild: find the Great Owl, Nikta, and pluck out the\nSowing Eye. While this may solve the immediate problem,\nthe long-term consequences are not being considered, just\nas they weren’t when Haven invaded.\nHaven’s beleaguered spymaster, Kreil Dirn (he/him), is not\na popular person in Haven. He is responsible for rooting out\ninsurgents, stopping schemes before they have a chance to\nstart, and keeping a close watch on Haven’s internal activities.\nKreil has never agreed—at least not openly—with Archmage\nPhylax’s (they/them) decision to steal the Reaping Eye, and\nthe consequences they’ve all paid for that decision have been\ngrimly vindicating.\nRecently, Kreil uncovered the Fanewraith’s plot and is horrified\nby the possibility of her success. Knowing he can’t send a\ntroop of Haven soldiers deep into the woods to hunt down and\nstop the Fanewraith from stealing the Sowing Eye, Kreil uses\nhis vast network of informants and spies to find a group of\nadventurers who can bring the Fanewraith to swift justice.\nThe party is sent an invitation from Haven to meet with\nKreil. But is his information correct? Does he have his own\nmotivation or secret ambition? Whether they come from\nFanewick or Haven, the party must extend some trust to a\nperson who is equally as dangerous and mercurial as the\n“enemy” they pursue. And what will they do when they find the\nFanewraith? Bring her to justice? Side with her? Attempt to\nrecover the Reaping Eye?\nKreil advises the party to start their hunt for the Fanewraith\nin the treetop village of Alula, where he suspects she runs her\noperation.\nCAMPAIGN MECHANICS\nThe following mechanics are unique to this campaign.\nCorruption from the Witherwild\nAdversaries and environments in this campaign can gain\nan additional type called Withered. When an adversary is\nWithered, describe how the Witherwild changed or impacted\nhow they would normally appear or operate. You also need\nabout 20 Wither tokens (these can be the same as the tokens\nyou use for Fear).\nAny time a PC takes Severe damage from a Withered\nadversary or environment, gain a Wither token and place it\non that PC’s character sheet. When you do, the PC must roll\ntheir Fear Die. If they roll equal to or below the number of\nWither tokens on their sheet, they immediately gain a scar and\nclear all tokens, describing how the Witherwild changes them\npermanently.\nAt the end of each session, clear all Wither tokens from the\nPCs’ sheets and gain an equal amount of Fear. If a character\never dies with Wither tokens on their sheet, their body is\npermanently taken over by the Witherwild.\nSESSION ZERO QUESTIONS\nAsk any of these questions to your players, or make your own.\n• What dangerous animal comes out during the week of\nnight that isn’t out during the week of day?\n• What unique trait (such as appearance, smell, or taste)\ndoes anything tainted by the Witherwild have?\n• What superstitions does your character or their\ncommunity have about traversing Fanewick during the\nlong nights?\n• Your character has witnessed something beautiful that\ncame from the Witherwild. What is it and how has it\ntransformed their view of the corruption?\n• If your character is from Fanewick, what commodity do\nthey secretly enjoy that comes from Haven?

All five nations\ndeploy agents to strengthen alliances, sabotage foes, and tip\nthe balance of power in their favor.

Uninterested in paying back the fortunes\nstolen by their forebears, they seek strength and recognition\nthrough naval superiority. Armada is allied with Jesthaen and\nis disliked by Voldaen and Hilltop.\nHilltop is a rich theocracy that exerts a monopoly on access\nto the gods, giving them holdings in the other nations’\nsettlements from capitals down to villages. Hilltop is an old\nally of Voldaen and is unfriendly toward Armada and Jesthaen.\nJesthaen is a young republic recently independent from\nVoldaen after a bloody but short war. They seek to prove their\nstrength through displays of military might. Jesthaen is allied\nwith Armada and allies of convenience with Polaris.\nPolaris is a progress-focused magocracy at the beginning of a\nmagical industrial revolution. They are ideological rivals with\nVoldaen and allies of convenience with Jesthaen.\nVoldaen is a proud monarchy with traditional authority and\nriches, recently shaken by Jesthaen’s secession. They are an\nold ally of Hilltop and ideological rivals of Polaris.\nThese five nations once flew under one banner. In the age of\ngods, the divinities protected their mortal creations, clashing\nwith primordial powers of chaos and striking them down.\nWith victory secured, the peoples of Althas crowned their first\nqueen—a dwarven seraph named Arvold—and founded the\nnation of Voldaen. Meanwhile, the gods established their seat\nin what is now known as Hilltop, but departed centuries later\nto fight otherworldly foes.\nOver the next several centuries, factional differences within\nVoldaen grew untenable. With the gods absent, their priests\nasserted their authority as divine regents of Hilltop. Later,\na group of scholars and mages who wished to push the\nboundaries of arcane knowledge broke off and founded the\nnation of Polaris. Alliances of pirate navies began settling\ndown in trade cities, forming the federation of Armada. And\njust fifteen years ago, groups of workers and anti-monarchists\ndeclared independence from Voldaen to establish their own\nnation, known as Jesthaen. This bloody revolution consumed\nthe continent, with Hilltop coming to Voldaen’s aid while\nPolaris and Armada supported the Jesthaen rebels. Active\ncombat ended five years ago with an armistice, but the peace\nremains tenuous.\nThe emergence of Jesthaen as a nascent military force has\nredrawn the lines of power, challenging Voldaen and Hilltop’s\ntraditional authority. But the alliance between Polaris and\nthe upstart nations of Armada and Jesthaen is fragile, and\nthere are many in both Voldaen and Jesthaen with unfinished\nbusiness from the war. Minor border clashes and trade\ndisputes threaten to boil over. Many believe that war is coming\nagain—it’s only a matter of when and how.\nFive Banners Burning is an emotionally intense campaign with\na large cast and sweeping scope, where the characters will\nfind themselves in the crucible that forges the fate of nations.\nThe campaign leans toward a nuanced moral landscape, with\nmorality and ethics in tension with duty and allegiance. Heroes\nmay do terrible things that weigh upon them, and most villains\nare motivated by love and loyalty as often as ambition or\nvengeance.\nFIVE BANNERS BURNING\n263\tChapter 5: Five Banners Burning\n\n-- 264 of 415 --\n\nCOMMUNITIES\nAll communities are available, but some have unique aspects within a Five Banners Burning campaign. As needed, provide the\nfollowing information to your players and choose one or more of the questions to ask them during your session zero.\nHighborne and Orderborne\nAlthas’ highborne and orderborne communities play an\nespecially central role in this campaign, as they are most\nstrongly associated with the centers of power in the five\nnations. Highborne characters are likely connected to the\nruling class of the five major nations of Althas.\n• Are you a member of the aristocracy or nobility, or the\nscion of a prominent merchant or priest family?\n• What expectations does your community have of you, and\ndo you intend to live up to them?\nDefined by their relationship to strongly held tenets,\norderborne communities are most common in Hilltop and\nVoldaen. An orderborne character will have their community’s\nideals tested by the conflict between nations—those that live\nby a code will be called to die for it.\n• How do you see the tenets you grew up with being\nchanged or broken as tensions rise?\n• What lines are you willing to cross to protect the people\nyou love?\nRidgeborne, Underborne, and Wildborne\nAlthas is a mountainous continent, and Ridgeborne\ncommunities are common in every nation, often feeling\nmore kinship with one another than the lowlander\ncommunities. Underborne communities can be found\nbeneath mountaintops, in oceanside caverns, and deeper\nstill. Wildborne communities are more rare, often founded by\npeople interested in escaping the larger conflicts of Althas.\n• What resources or assets does your community have that\nother nations might want to take for themselves?\n• Who from your community was conscripted in past\nconflicts, and what tales do they tell of their battles?\nLoreborne\nLoreborne communities are especially prominent in Polaris—\nincluding magic academics, engineers, architects, and other\nscholars—but these communities exist in every nation. For\nexample, priests safeguard religious histories and knowledge\nin Hilltop, while sages advise families and maintain the\ncontinuity of knowledge in Voldaen.\n• What kind of knowledge does your community prioritize,\nand how does it influence the powerful figures in your\nhome nation?\n• What secrets does your community protect or control?\nWhat impact would those secrets have on the burgeoning\nconflict?\nSeaborne\nSeaborne communities are common across Althas, save in\nlandlocked Polaris. They are home to the continent’s most\naccomplished sailors, navigators, and fisherpeople, torn\nbetween a life lived tide-to-tide and the pull to duty in serving\nnations once more on the brink of war.\n• How is naval power being exercised in your community?\n• What do you fear will happen if the conflict comes to your\ncommunity by land?\nSlyborne\nSlyborne communities are found across Althas, but are\nespecially prominent in Jesthaen and Armada. There, criminal\norganizations have been instrumental in improving their\nnations’ fortunes, from smugglers supporting the Jesthaen\nrevolution to the tight-knit pirate families that founded\nArmada with goods taken from Voldaen, Polaris, and Hilltop.\n• What is your community’s relationship to their nation?\nHow are they using the political instability to their\nadvantage?\n• What communities from other nations does your\ncommunity do business with? How are those connections\nstrained?\nWanderborne\nWanderborne characters belong to no single region of\nAlthas—but though they may consider themselves outside the\nauthority of the five nations, it will be very difficult to avoid the\nbrewing conflict.\n• Are your people claimed as subjects of one of the nations?\n• How has the growing conflict altered your community’s\ntravels?\nFIVE BANNERS BURNING\n264 \tChapter 5: Five Banners Burning\n\n-- 265 of 415 --\n\nANCESTRIES\nAll ancestries are available, but some have unique aspects\nwithin a Five Banners Burning campaign.\nCLASSES\nAll classes are available, but some have unique aspects within\na Five Banners Burning campaign.\nPLAYER PRINCIPLES\nIf your group decides to play this campaign, give your players\nthe following information before character creation.\nMake Your Actions Reflect or Refute Your\nAllegiances\nYou will be implicated in the actions of your superiors, who\nmay, at times, give questionable orders and condemn you for\nany signs of dissent. Consider your character’s loyalty to those\nthey serve—every action they take is a chance to strengthen\ntheir reflection of an ideal or stand against something they\noppose.

When that war will break out depends on you, but\nit is almost inevitable. The conflict between nations will be\nfought in ballrooms and back alleys as much as in castles and\nvalleys, and people from all backgrounds will be caught in the\ngrowing conflict despite their best efforts.\nTipping the Scales of History\nThe party will be in a unique position to have a significant\nimpact on the conflict between these nations.

Voldaen denies all involvement and sends\na diplomatic investigative party to Lightning Valley, a border\ntown known both for the giant lightning rods that protect the\ntown from magical storms and for hosting the talks that ended\nofficial hostilities between Voldaen and the revolutionary\nfaction. However, days later, reports tell of some kind of\n“disaster” during the initial meetings between Voldaen and\nJesthaen’s representatives.\nThe party is sent to Lightning Valley to investigate what\nhappened. There, they find representatives from other nations\ndoing the same—the apprentice of a disappeared mage-\ninquisitor, a divine seeker from Hilltop investigating potential\ndivine implications, a Voldaen judge who once served as the\ntown magistrate “returning to visit family,” and a merchant-\ndiplomat from Armada.\nThe following NPCs comprise the cast embroiled in this\nmystery:\nClover of Towers wants to make their mother proud and find a\nway to be happy far from home. Before their kidnapping, they\nwere last seen drinking with city guards at the Three Poles\ntavern, built between several lightning poles. They were too\nyoung to fight in the war, and they have a sense of inferiority\nabout not having bled for the freedom they now enjoy.\nOziver of Storms, sheriff of Lightning Valley (ridgeborne\nsimiah, he/him), is trying to keep the peace but is quickly\nbecoming overwhelmed by the attention and stakes. Oziver\nis eager for help but needs reassurance of any outsider’s\ngoodwill. He knows that a city guard was the last to be seen\nwith Clover, but he’s convinced the still-missing guard isn’t to\nblame.\nCerulean Prism, apprentice Mage-Inquisitor of Polaris\n(loreborne clank, he/him), is quiet and diligent, though\nworried by Clover’s sudden disappearance. While working for\nEnchanter Kalashae, Cerulean managed correspondence with\nClover during the marriage negotiations. They’ve fallen for the\nfirbolg and will take reckless action to find them.\nKostren, Seeker of Hilltop (orderborne halfling, she/her), is\na formidable presence used to being obeyed. She takes over\nthe local temple as her base of operations, conscripting the\nclergy for a divination ritual that will locate Clover. She tells\nanyone that will listen of her vision that “proves” foul play by\nthe mages of Polaris. Kostren is exaggerating the certainty of\nthis vision to stoke renewed conflict so that Hilltop can claim\nmore fertile land.\nZeshthon, County Judge of Voldaen (highborne dwarf,\nthey/them), is an elderly dwarf with a compelling silence\nabout them that people can’t help but fill with conversation.\nThey volunteered for the inquiry so they could visit their\ngrandniece, a cobbler residing in the town. A dedicated art\ncollector, Zesthon hopes to procure embargoed tapestries\nfrom Goledraelle, which could lead to exposing the merchant’s\ntrue identity as a spy.\nGoledraelle, merchant of Armada (seaborne elf, he/him), is a\ncharming but hapless-seeming textiles merchant. This image\nof incompetence is a cover he deploys to throw off suspicion\nof his true agenda; in truth, Goledraelle is an Armadan spy\ndispatched to ensure the marriage happens as planned.\nThe original investigators arrived two days after Clover’s\ndisappearance and set out into the hills to the east, but\nhave not checked in for over a week. Did they suffer the\nsame fate as the firbolg? What help from the townsfolk did\nthe kidnappers have, and who else knows about it? Which\nenemies of Jesthaen, Polaris, or Armada were in position\nto sabotage the marriage? Was the marriage sabotaged by\nsomeone within Jesthaen for other reasons?\nDid some danger or threat lead Clover from the town without\ntheir escort? Or was this part of Clover’s plan all along, a\nchance to live free of their mother’s expectations?\nWhich of the second wave of investigators will be the first to\nlearn where Clover went?

These countdowns can also tick up or\ndown if their progress is influenced by the fiction.\nA completed countdown represents a nation gaining access to\nan asset, removing a problem, developing new technology or\ninitiatives, changing political or social fortunes, or acquiring an\nequally useful benefit. When a countdown is completed, pick a\nnew objective based on the fiction and start a new countdown.\nEach nation can have one major objective countdown and up\nto two minor objective countdowns at a time.\nCompleting major objectives requires a 10-step countdown,\nwhile minor objectives have 4 to 6 steps depending on the\nscale of the endeavor. Stagger the nations’ countdowns so\nthat as they start completing, only one or two are reaching\nan objective and changing the political landscape each week;\nif you trigger all five nations’ countdowns at the same time,\nthere will be weeks of inactivity afterward, lessening the\ntension of the brewing conflicts.\nThe party may often be dispatched or mobilized to complete\nor block these objectives. Meanwhile, completed countdowns\ngenerate major narrative shifts for the party to respond to.\nSESSION ZERO QUESTIONS\nAsk any of these questions to your players, or make your own.\n• Should all the characters come from and/or have\nallegiance to the same nation? Why are they allied and\ntraveling together?\n• How big of a role will war play in this campaign compared\nto other elements like diplomacy, intrigue, or mystery?\n• How much conflict do we want between PCs? What safety\ntools will we use to negotiate those conflicts when they\noccur?\nExample: The party spends a week traveling by airship\nfrom Armada to Polaris to seek counsel from High Circle\nscholars about ancient script discovered in an abandoned\nruin. During that time, the GM chooses one countdown per\nnation to advance as time passes.\nFirst, they tick down Voldaen’s 10-step countdown to seize\none of Armada’s shipping fleets from 7 to 6, representing\nthe nation’s scouts and sailors observing the current state\nof Armada’s navy: how many ships the pirates have, what\nkinds of ships they are, and what they’re being used for.\nInspired by a scene where the PCs had to prove their\nmagical prowess to the Polaris captain to secure passage,\nthe GM chooses to tick down Armada’s 4-step countdown\nto acquire airship technology from Polaris, representing\nArmada’s diplomatic and trade efforts to access the\ncarefully guarded magitech.\nFor Hilltop, the GM ticks down their 4-step countdown—\nrepresenting a massive ritual to bless this year’s harvest\nand increase their yield—from 1 to 0, completing the\ncountdown. The GM makes a note to spread news of its\nsuccess, as this addresses Hilltop’s food shortage. They also\nnote to think of a new countdown for Hilltop.\nPolaris has two projects with 3 ticks remaining, so the GM\ndecides to tick down their major countdown to perfect their\nservitor technology to 2 as the magitechnicians scale up\nwider tests of the promising prototype.\nLastly, the GM ticks down Jesthaen’s project—taking\nreligious authority in their nation from Hilltop—to 4. This\ncountdown had recently ticked up from 4 to 5 after the\nPCs chose to investigate cult rumors in Armada rather\nthan assist Jesthaen in convincing Hilltop priests to cede\nauthority.\nFIVE BANNERS BURNING\n269\tChapter 5: Five Banners Burning\n\n-- 270 of 415 --\n\nBEAST FEAST\nWhen a small village’s monster defense system fails, the local heroes must venture into the\nendless caverns below to fix it—and cook up trouble for the creatures that stand in their way!\nDesigned by Banana Chan, Rowan Hall, & Spenser Starke\nComplexity Rating: ••\nTHE PITCH\nRead this section to your players to introduce them to the\ncampaign.\nThe rustic, peaceful village of Elmore sits atop the Plover\nCaves, a labyrinthine system of caverns full of dangerous and\ndelectable creatures. When the powerful magic keeping the\nvillagers safe begins to fail, the bravest among them must\ndescend into the caves to save the day. In a Beast Feast\ncampaign, you’ll play everyday heroes diving into the Plover\nCaves to reignite the magic lure that lies in its depths—and\ncook up delicious meals. Welcome to a culinary world of\nzoophagous delight, where the beasts you fight become the\nfood you eat!\nTONE & FEEL\nAbsurd, Comedic, Creepy, Fun, Lighthearted, Silly\nTHEMES\nCircle of Life, Friendship & Loyalty, Nature’s Bounty,\nOvercoming Fear, Violence & Peace\nTOUCHSTONES\nDelicious in Dungeon, Monster Hunter World, One Piece\n270 \tChapter 5: Beast Feast\n\n-- 271 of 415 --\n\nOVERVIEW\nIf your group decides to play this campaign, give your players the following information before character creation.\nLong ago, within the heart of the Plover Caves, Hylaeus\nthe Forest Mage (she/her) cast a powerful spell, creating a\nLure that draws dangerous creatures from the surrounding\narea into the caverns. For centuries, this kept any harm from\ncoming to the village of Elmore. However, the caves are now\nfilled to the brim with strange, unexpected creatures from\nacross the region—and the remnants of outsiders brave or\nfoolhardy enough to venture into them. But nobody from\nElmore is foolish enough to be caught dead in the caves. The\nquiet, rustic village is full of bakers and weavers, farmers and\ncobblers, with ne’er a sword in sight. The villagers are more\nconcerned about not mucking up their contribution to the\nyearly Stewpot Festival than the dangers outside their walls.\nThat was until the village’s beloved halfling mayor Doug\nDougle (he/him) was attacked by a dangerous creature during\nhis daily hike through Plover Woods. The Lure created by\nHylaeus all those years ago is fading, and with it, Elmore’s\nprotection. As increasingly dangerous beasts stalk the\nwoods, the villagers have banded together to reignite the\nancient spell, calling on anyone who might pick up a blade to\ndescend into the caves and save their people. Unfortunately,\nthe defenseless people of Elmore have ceased hunting and\nforaging in Plover Woods for fear of attack until the Lure is\nreactivated—there isn’t much to spare, so every bite in town\nis precious. Anyone venturing into the caves will have to hunt\nand prepare their own food while they’re down there!\nThe easiest way to find the Plover Caves is to take the western\nroad out of Elmore and follow the birdsong of piping plovers.\nOld tales from this area say these small birds are the only\ncreatures that move freely in and out of the tunnels without\nlosing themselves to the depths, so following them almost\nalways leads to an entrance—or an exit.\nThe old tales also say the Plover Caves are endless—this isn’t\ntrue, but it might as well be. They stretch on for hundreds\nof miles underground, deeper and more sprawling than even\nthe most adventurous explorer could map in their lifetime.\nThe entry path leads down on a sharp decline for miles until\nit finally splits into many branches leading to various regions\nwithin the cave system. Here, different biomes are home to\nunique creatures, wonderous flora, and valuable treasures\nleft behind by adventurers past. The deeper you go, the more\ndangerous and delicious the creatures are, and the more\nprecious and powerful the treasure is. And even deeper still\nlies the Lure.\nThose from Elmore might be surprised to find there are many\npeople happily living and working in the dark, dangerous\ncaverns. Most reside in camps, but more permanent\nresidents have small cabins carved out of rock along the\ntunnels. The culture in the Plover Caves is very communal,\nand ambitious folks have set up shops for bartering or trade.\nMost major caverns even host a Berry’s—the chain of small\nrestaurants that serve the catch of the day, fresh and hot, in\nexchange for gold. Residents might stop in when they’re too\ntired or ingredient-poor to cook for themselves, but Berry’s\nrestaurants are also hubs for gossip, entertainment, and\nwarnings about what dangerous beasts might be lurking\nnearby.\nBEAST FEAST\n271\tChapter 5: Beast Feast\n\n-- 272 of 415 --\n\nCOMMUNITIES\nAll communities are available, but some have unique aspects within a Beast Feast campaign. As needed, provide the following\ninformation to your players and choose one or more of the questions to ask them during your session zero.\nAll Communities\nIn a Beast Feast campaign, the characters are villagers from\nElmore. If a player wants to create a character whose chosen\ncommunity wouldn’t be found in this peaceful village, work\nwith them to determine where their character originally came\nfrom. Perhaps they grew up in an orderborne community and\nmoved to Elmore to be in a less restrictive environment, or\nthey were a slyborne adventurer who settled in the village\nafter retiring from their shady deeds. The following sections\ndescribe a few communities in more detail and how they could\ntie into this campaign.\nUnderborne\nUnderborne folk may be from the Plover Caves, but even if\nnot, they will likely thrive in this labyrinth. Their eyes need not\nadjust to the darkness, nor do their hands quake at the touch\nof the sour ants crawling in the dirt. This is home for them.\n• Despite being accustomed to your own underground\nenvironment, what’s something you’ve heard is unique\nabout the Plover Caves?\n• You have a particular dish from your own cave system that\nyou’re hoping to cook on this adventure. What makes it\nspecial?\n• You were injured by a cave creature once. How did that\nexperience change you?\nRidgeborne\nThe rocky, rough environment is familiar to ridgeborne\ncharacters. Though the cuisine is probably much different\nthan they’re used to, they’re likely accustomed to catching,\nkilling, and preparing their own food.\n• What specific dish do you miss from home?\n• You struggle with a lack of open space. What do you plan\nto carry with you to help steady your nerves?\n• You think a lesson from the mountains will help you in the\nPlover Caves. What did you learn, and how did you learn it?\nLoreborne\nAs devourers of knowledge, loreborne characters might\nbelieve the Plover Caves provide a unique opportunity to\nobserve a strange ecosystem that brings together beasts that\nwould never normally live in the same environment.\n• What rumor about the beasts in Plover Caves have you\nheard? How has that changed how you operate in the\ncaverns?\n• What specific piece of knowledge are you seeking while\nunderground?\n• You plan to record information to bring back to someone.\nWho is it, and why is this so important to you?\nANCESTRIES\nAll ancestries are available, but some have unique aspects\nwithin a Beast Feast campaign. As needed, provide the\nfollowing information to your players.\nClanks\nClanks can consume organic matter, but they may lack the\nability to taste the food. Instead, they might enjoy the culinary\narts for other qualities, such as texture or aesthetics.\nFungril\nFungril can hear mushrooms screaming as they are harvested.\nUnfortunately, a majority of plant life in the Plover Caves is\nfungi—adventurers might need to find alternative ingredients\nif it helps make cooking a more shame-free activity.\nCLASSES\nAll classes are available, but some have unique aspects within\na Beast Feast campaign. As needed, provide the following\ninformation to your players.\nAll Classes\nThe people of Elmore have lived peacefully for generations.\nThanks to Hylaeus, the region’s dangerous creatures are\nenticed to the caves; meanwhile, other towns or armies have\nlargely left the unassuming village alone. When players select\nmartial abilities or spells, they should consider how and why\ntheir characters learned these techniques or what skills\nthey’ve adapted on this journey.\nBEAST FEAST\n272 \tChapter 5: Beast Feast\n\n-- 273 of 415 --\n\nPLAYER PRINCIPLES\nIf your group decides to play this campaign, give your players\nthe following information before character creation.\nBuild on Humble Origins\nWhen you make a character for this campaign, they should\nbe a villager from Elmore who has gathered what tools they\ncan to descend into the Plover Caves in hopes of saving\ntheir people. Think about what quaint or mundane job your\ncharacter holds in the village and how it might have prepared\nthem for their new role as a hero. Perhaps they’re a florist who\nknows about plants, a clockmaker with dexterous fingers, a\nmage who runs a humble potion shop, a blacksmith with a\nstrong hammer-arm, or a chef with a particular adeptness for\nknives. Use your character’s occupation as inspiration for their\nexperiences, the kind of weapon they carry, and how to flavor\nany features you choose for your character.\nSlay and Filet\nHave you tried eating it? No? Well, then how do you know it’s\nnot food? Carry a curious mindset with you as your character\nexplores the caves, learning about the various beasts and\nblooms that could make a delicious meal (and potentially an\nexcellent addition to your cookbook).\nBalance Comedy and Heart\nIf there’s a place for a silly character name, a low-stakes\nyet important life goal, a weird personality quirk, or a zany\naesthetic, it’s this campaign frame. Embrace the fun, make\nbold choices, and look for opportunities to set up your\ncharacter’s allies for comedic moments. Additionally, let your\ncharacter experience vulnerability, reveal a hard personal\ntruth, or bond with another character over something\nimportant to them. Strive to balance comedic and heartfelt\nmoments.\nGM PRINCIPLES\nKeep the following guidance in mind while you GM this\ncampaign.\nMake It Delicious\nDescribe the world through a fun, over-the-top culinary lens.\nWhen describing beasts, highlight the parts of them that could\nbe particularly useful in a dish or valuable to a specific recipe.\nWhen describing the environment, lean on the PCs’ senses—\nespecially smell and taste—to draw them in and provide\ndetails they don’t see. Use food-related colors (“the glass orb\nyou find is the color of rich honey”), names (“she introduces\nherself as Penelope Pepperbottom”), and comparisons (“you\nmarch your way through the sludge of the tunnel, thick like\nmolasses”) to immerse your players in the world.\nGive Them Purpose\nThough it can be fun to slay some beasts and make some\nmeals, the novelty will soon wear off if the story you’re telling\ndoesn’t have purpose and stakes. While the long-term goal\nmight be to reach the Lure and revitalize its magic, ensure you\nintroduce short-term goals and break the adventure up into\nmore session-to-session story developments. Give players a\nreason to return to Elmore every few sessions to contrast the\nworld above and the world below.\nCreate Personal Conflict\nCrafting meals isn’t just about slaying beasts to make great\ndinner; it’s also about competing with other Plover Caves\ndelvers for the finest ingredients! Introduce conflict, such as\nrivals who want to see the PCs fail so they can gain control of\nthe Plover Caves. Make ingredients scarce so that when word\nbreaks out that a popular protein is nearby, the party must\nrace to claim it before others do.\nBEAST FEAST\n273\tChapter 5: Beast Feast\n\n-- 274 of 415 --\n\nDISTINCTIONS\nUse this information to prepare your campaign. You can also share it with your players as needed.\nA Cave of Wonders\nPlover Caves’ biomes are as varied as any surface biomes,\nand often stranger and more disconcerting. A windstorm\nmight whip through the tunnels, uprooting massive plants and\nblocking exits. A sudden, excessive expulsion of moisture from\nthe weeping skyflowers overhead might cause a torrential\ndownpour that floods a cave. A cavern’s ground might be\nso soft and thick that you begin to sink if you stand still too\nlong. Some even refer to the Plover Caves as a distinct entity\nitself—not just a cave system, but a massive creature of its\nown.\nAdditionally, there are distinct features within the caves most\nadventurers will stumble across:\nLayers of the cavern represent how deep an adventurer\nis within the Plover Caves, with each layer representing\nbetween 200 and 500 vertical feet. Common adventurers\ngenerally stay within the first layer, but the most ambitious\nventure deeper. Most stories describe four distinct layers\n(The Shallows, Twilight, Abyss, and Hadral), but veteran\nexplorers have told tales of many, many more.\nBrilliance is a geodesic dome that shines so brightly it\nmimics the sunlight from the outside world. Some veteran\nexplorers practice meditation and morning rituals in this\ndome, often asking one another, “Will you be at Brilliance\ntoday?”\nReflection of the Stars is Plover Caves’ primary lake. It’s\nfed by an underground spring and sits beneath a ceiling\ndotted with bioluminescent morsels, such as the glowing\nmantis and the brightclaw scorpion. The aquatic creatures\nwho call this place home range from small almond guppies\nto medium-sized jellyfish to the dreaded ironshark and the\nmassive angler squid, whose many eyes are considered a\ndelicacy.\nThe Catacombs are the deepest point of the third layer of\nthe cavern, thus named because the ground is covered in\nso many layers of bones, one cannot step without breaking\na few and drawing attention to themself. Some of Plover\nCaves’ residents say the most horrifying beasts bring their\nprey to the Catacombs for consumption, making it a hotbed\nof dangerous creatures. Passing through the Catacombs\nsuccessfully is the only way to explore deeper than the\nAbyss.\nBeasts and Blooms\nThis campaign uses the terms beasts and blooms for\nthe animals and plants/fungi that are edible in this world.\nAnything with distinct personhood isn’t considered a beast\nor a bloom, even if they resemble something that would\notherwise be edible—for example, fungril and drakona.\nBecause the magical Lure compels creatures from across the\nregion into the Plover Caves, an endless variety of strange\nbeasts and blooms live within them—not just ones normally\nfound in caves! In this world, it would make sense to find a\npack of velociraptors descending on a six-legged dire ostrich\nthat is, in turn, snacking on a patch of starfish mushrooms.\nThese caves hold an ecosystem unlike any other, and every\nedible thing that could exist down here likely does.\nThe Lure\nThe Lure is the orb of concentrated magic created by Hylaeus\nthe Forest Mage to trap dangerous creatures within the\nPlover Caves. It’s most commonly believed the Lure resides\nsomewhere in the lowest levels of the Hadral layer, but no one\nis certain where. Because so little is known about this great\nsource of power, there are many questions to answer about it\nover the course of the campaign:\n• How was it made?\n• What was sacrificed to create it?\n• Why has its power started to fade?\n• What will the PCs need to do to activate it again?\nBEAST FEAST\n274 \tChapter 5: Beast Feast\n\n-- 275 of 415 --\n\nBEAST FEAST\nThe following mechanics are unique to this campaign.\nBEAST FEAST STARTING EQUIPMENT\nAs everyday heroes with no access to standard weapons, PCs must choose their Tier 1 starting equipment from the following\ntables instead of the equipment tables in chapter 2.\nPrimary Physical Weapons\nName \tTrait \tRange \tDamage \tBurden \tFeature\nCleaver \tAgility \tMelee \td8 phy \tOne-Handed \tReliable: +1 to attack rolls\nSharpened\nRake Agility \tMelee \td8+3 phy \tTwo-Handed \t—\nButcher’s Axe \tStrength \tMelee \td12+3 phy \tTwo-Handed \tHeavy: −1 to Evasion\nIron Skillet \tStrength \tMelee \td8+1 phy \tOne-Handed \t—\nPitchfork \tStrength \tMelee \td10+3 phy \tTwo-Handed \t—\nSledgehammer \tStrength \tMelee \td10+3 phy \tTwo-Handed\nMassive: −1 to Agility; on a successful attack,\nroll an additional damage die and discard the\nlowest result.\nCooking Knife \tFinesse \tMelee \td8+1 phy \tOne-Handed \t—\nWalking Staff \tInstinct \tMelee \td10+3 phy \tTwo-Handed \t—\nRolling Pin \tPresence \tMelee \td8+1 phy \tOne-Handed \t—\nSickle \tPresence \tMelee \td8 phy \tOne-Handed\nQuick: When you make an attack, you can\nmark a Stress to target another creature\nwithin range.\nForge Poker \tStrength \tVery Close \td8+2 phy \tTwo-Handed \t—\nCrop Scythe \tFinesse \tVery Close \td8+2 phy \tTwo-Handed \t—\nFishing Rod \tAgility \tFar \td6+3 phy \tTwo-Handed \t—\nSlingshot \tFinesse \tFar \td6+3 phy \tTwo-Handed \t—\nFirework\nLauncher Agility \tVery Far \td6+3 phy \tTwo-Handed \tCumbersome: −1 to Finesse\nTHE INCITING INCIDENT\nYou can use the prompt below to start your campaign, or create your own.\nAfter the attack on Mayor Dougle, the local alchemist, Carat\n(they/them), approaches the party.

Carat\ncan transmute twelve drops of this venom into a spicy paste,\nwhich they can spread around the borders of the village to\ntemporarily keep dangerous creatures at bay.\nCarat explains that ghost scorpions tend to make their\nnests by flattening the tall grasses of the Overgrowth into\nstrange circular patterns. To get to the Overgrowth, the party\ncan follow the smell of jasmine through the northernmost\nchamber of the Shallows.

The players should choose a small\nnotebook they can share, then decorate it as they’d like (stickers, colored markers, and paint are highly encouraged). This\nnotebook is their cookbook—during downtime, they’ll record each recipe they make, including its name, the ingredients, the\ncooking method, and how it turned out. The cookbook is shared by the players, who should all get the chance to contribute to it.\nThe more the characters practice making meals with the same flavor profile, the easier that combination becomes to prepare!\nThe Beast Feast!\nDuring downtime, the PCs recover from their adventuring by\nmaking a meal from the bounty of ingredients gathered from\nthe caverns.\nEvery ingredient PCs gather has a flavor profile, which is\ndetermined by the 1–3 flavors that comprise it and the\nstrength of those flavors.\nEach flavor has a die size associated with it:\n→ Sweet (d4)\n→ Salty (d6)\n→ Bitter (d8)\n→ Sour (d10)\n→ Savory (d12)\n→ Weird (d20)\nA flavor’s strength is a value between 1 and 3, which is the\nnumber of the flavor’s associated dice the players roll when\ncooking with the ingredient. A PC can hold a number of\ningredients equal to the value of their highest character trait.\nThe following list provides examples of ingredients and their\nflavor profiles:\n• Mushroom caps: Bitter (1), Savory (2)\n• Wyvern tongue: Sour (1), Savory (1), Weird (1)\n• Ooze marrow: Sweet (1), Bitter (2)\n• Direbear meat: Savory (3)\n• Acid dragon saliva: Sour (2)\n• Cave boar milk: Salty (1), Savory (1)\n• Rileroot: Bitter (1)\n• Ogre kidney stone: Sweet (1), Weird (1)\nExample: In this case, mushroom caps would contribute\n1d8 and 2d12 to the meal.\nHunting Beasts for Ingredients!\nEvery beast that PCs fight provides ingredients they can\nharvest. A beast’s maximum Hit Points determine how many\ningredients they produce.\nHit Point Guide\n→ 4 or lower: 1 ingredient\n→ 5–7: 2 ingredients\n→ 8–10: 3 ingredients\n→ 12 or higher: 4 ingredients\nWhile the adversary’s Hit Points determine the number of\ningredients, you set the flavor profile and strength. Use the\nnarrative details of the adversary to inform these choices.\nOften, less difficult adversaries have flavor profiles with\nsmaller dice (Sweet, Salty, and Bitter), and more powerful\nadversaries have flavor profiles with larger dice (Sour, Savory,\nand Weird).\nGathering Blooms for Ingredients!\nPCs can also obtain ingredients from their environment—\nthese are called blooms. Once per rest, each PC can spend a\nHope to gather blooms from their surroundings.

When they choose this\nmove, the PCs can contribute any ingredients they’re carrying\nto the party’s collective meal and gain the benefits of the\nresulting feast.\nThe PCs who choose to Make a Feast during downtime\nprepare the food together. They should collaborate to decide\nwhich ingredients they’re using, then erase those ingredients\nfrom their inventory. Then they come up with a name and\ndescription for the dish and record it in their party’s cookbook.\nWhen the PCs begin cooking, they roll the appropriate number\nof flavor dice. For example, the party decides to make a steak\ndinner with the following recipe:\n• 1 serving of direbear meat \t→ 3d12\n• 1 serving of mushroom caps → 2d12 + 1d8\n• 1 serving of ooze marrow \t→ 2d8 + 1d4\nThis gives the party 5d12, 3d8, and 1d4 as the meal’s flavor\ndice. They roll the dice and look for any matching values. If\nthere are no matching values, they discard a single die of their\nchoice, then roll the pool again to continue cooking. When\nthey get any number of matching values, players collect those\ndice off to the side and continue rolling. When they have only\none die left, the meal is done!\nNext, players take each set of matched dice (which can\nconsist of two or more dice per set) and add their values\ntogether. For example, a d6 and a d8 that rolled matching\n3s would be worth 3. A d10 and d12 that rolled matching 4s\nwould be worth 4. A d8 and a d20 that rolled matching 4s (on\na different roll) would also be worth 4. Together, they have a\nMeal Rating of 11.\nAll PCs who eat the meal can individually use the value of the\nMeal Rating to clear Hit Points, clear Stress, and gain Hope,\ndividing this value however they’d like. For example, with a\nMeal Rating of 11, one PC might choose to clear 6 Hit Points,\nclear 4 Stress, and gain 1 Hope. Another might choose to clear\n5 Hit Points, clear 4 Stress, and gain 2 Hope.\nAnytime a party makes a dish with the same flavor profile as\nanother recipe they’ve previously recorded in their cookbook,\nthey should add a number of tokens equal to the party’s\ncurrent tier to their pool of flavor dice. When they must\ndiscard a die, they can instead discard one of these tokens.\nQUICK INGREDIENT GENERATOR!\nWhen the PCs harvest an ingredient, roll a d20 on each relevant table and use the combination to inspire what they gather.\nIf one of the options doesn’t fit the scenario, choose another that does.\nBeast:\nWhat kind of ingredient is it?\n1 \tFeet\n2 \tPowder\n3 \tLimb\n4 \tBelly\n5 \tFat\n6 \tEggs\n7 \tMarrow\n8 \tTongue\n9 \tBrain\n10 \tRibs\n11 \tOrgan\n12 \tFlesh\n13 \tStones\n14 \tEyes\n15 \tJelly\n16 \tHorn\n17 \tMeat\n18 \tScales\n19 \tWings\n20 \tSecretion\nBloom:\nWhat kind of ingredient is it?\n1 \tFlower\n2 \tRoots\n3 \tStems\n4 \tLeaves\n5 \tBulbs\n6 \tNuts\n7 \tSeeds\n8 \tBark\n9 \tBerries\n10 \tFruit\n11 \tSap\n12 \tPollen\n13 \tFungi\n14 \tNectar\n15 \tPods\n16 \tHerbs\n17 \tAlgae\n18 \tMoss\n19 \tGrain\n20 \tRind\nAny Ingredient:\nWhat’s interesting about it?\n1 \tIt’s particularly tender.\n2 \tIt’s still wriggling.\n3 \tIt looks like something it isn’t\n4 \tIt has a pungent smell.\n5 \tIt’s brightly colored.\n6 \tIt’s completely translucent.\n7 \tIt’s an odd size or shape.\n8 \tIt has unique markings.\n9 \tIt recoils from the light.\n10 \tIt withers in the dark.\n11 \tIt smells unbelievably good.\n12 \tIt has an unexpected texture.\n13 \tIt’s encased in something.\n14 \tIt’s filled with something.\n15 \tIt’s emitting a colorful gas.\n16 \tIt comes apart in layers.\n17 \tIt must be prepared in a strange way.\n18 \tIt’s leathery or cartilaginous.\n19 \tIt’s brittle.\n20 \tIt’s deadly when consumed raw.\n278 \tChapter 5: Beast Feast\n\n-- 279 of 415 --\n\nBEAST FEAST\nNEXT LEVEL FEAST!\nOnce your table is comfortable with the basics, you can give\nthe PCs opportunities to gather specific ingredients they’re\nlooking for based on what they’ve learned about the world.\nYou might also create ingredients that include features, giving\nthem additional details to consider when making their dishes.\nThese should be rarer than typical ingredients, only harvested\nfrom Leader or Solo adversaries.\nExample Ingredients with Features\nDIREGAZELLE SKULL MARROW\nSweet (1), Salty (1), Sour (1)\nBuilt for Speed: You gain a +1 bonus to your Agility until\nyour next short rest.\nHOLY COW’S MILK\nWeird (1)\nLast Drop: When you have only one die remaining while\ncooking, roll it and add the result to your Meal Rating.\nGHOST SCORPION VENOM\nSour (1), Savory (1)\nSpicy: If your flavor dice match on results of 8 or higher,\nyou can’t clear Stress using this dish.\nDEATHFLOWER\nBitter (2)\nRisky: If you roll no matches on your flavor dice, you clear\nall Hit Points and Stress and gain 3 Hope. If you roll any\nmatches on your flavor dice, your Meal Rating is 0 and you\nmust make a death move.\nBerry’s Restaurant\nWhen the PCs are near an open Berry’s Restaurant during\ntheir downtime, they can each spend a handful of gold to\norder food and choose a downtime move to clear Stress, clear\nHit Points, or gain Hope. Only 2 handfuls of gold can be spent\nper PC during downtime.\nSESSION ZERO QUESTIONS\nAsk any of these questions to your players, or make your own.\n• What dangerous creature attacked Mayor Dougle in the\nPlover Woods?\n• While your character is in the caves, who will they miss the\nmost back in Elmore?\n• What personal life goal does your character feel they may\nbe able to finally accomplish while in the caverns?\n• Why was your character so eager to leave Elmore to go on\nthis adventure?\n• What rumor did your character hear about the caves?\n• If your character is able to reestablish the Lure’s power,\nwhat favor do they plan to ask of the mayor?\n279\tChapter 5: Beast Feast\n\n-- 280 of 415 --\n\nTHE AGE OF UMBRA\nIn a dying world immersed in relentless shadow and nightmarish monsters, small communities\nhold fast to the light, hoping those who endure can find a way to save this broken realm before all\nis lost to darkness.\nDesigned by Matthew Mercer\nComplexity Rating: •••\nTHE PITCH\nRead this section to your players to introduce them to the\ncampaign.\nA century has passed since the God-King Othedias betrayed\nthe Pantheon, provoking divine punishment and abandonment\nby the gods that left the realm of the Halcyon Domain\nshattered, desolate, and eternally cursed. Throughout this\nshadow-choked land of decaying fortresses and dreadful\nmonstrosities, surviving communities cling to hope in the face\nof lightless oblivion. In an Age of Umbra campaign, you’ll play\nheroic survivors who protect their community from the terrors\nbeyond their walls, venture out into the unknown to hunt the\nnightmares that twist and grow with each fallen soul, seek\nanswers to the curses that corrupt this world, and perhaps\neven discover a way to change its fate.\nTONE & FEEL\nAncient, Daunting, Epic, Grim, Ominous, Terrifying, Tragic\nTHEMES\nApocalypse, Corruption, Darkness vs Light, Hope,\nRedemption, Survival\nTOUCHSTONES\nDark Souls, Kingdom Death: Monster, Berserk, The Seventh\nSeal, Blasphemous\n280 \tChapter 5: The Age of Umbra\n\n-- 281 of 415 --\n\nOVERVIEW\nIf your group decides to play this campaign, give your players the following information before character creation.\nThe Age of Umbra is a dark and broken age within the realm\nknown as the Halcyon Domain, which rots in the wake of its\nPantheon’s abandonment. Grandiose cities and awe-inspiring\ncathedrals to the Veiled Gods now crumble slowly into ruin,\nfallen bastions of the prosperous epoch ruled by the guiding\nhand of God-King Othedias. Othedias, chosen by the Veiled\nGods as the bridge to divinity, conspired with his Grand\nOrdinants and Aetherlords to enact clandestine machinations\nthat could shift the balance in celestial power, enraging the\npantheon.\nHis blasphemy was met with cataclysmic retribution. The\ngods rained destruction upon the land, ending the Old World\nand forsaking the surviving peoples of the Halcyon Domain\nto an existence of growing desolation. The Veiled Gods then\nabandoned this world in what is referred to as the Apostasy,\nleaving what remains to wither under ever-growing shadow,\nthe clouded skies growing darker with each passing generation\nas they herald the world’s slow death march into entropy and\noblivion.\nThe cycle of the soul has been sundered, cursing all who\nlive or ever will live with the “soul blight,” a mark upon every\nmortal ensuring that, upon their death, they will rise again as\na corrupted revenant bent on destroying everything they loved\nin their former life. If their risen body is destroyed, the marked\nsoul withdraws into the dark, ethereal mass known as the\nUmbra, seeking others to haunt and corrupt.\nIt’s now been nearly a century within the Age of Umbra, and\nthose who remain rebuild what they can among the ruins of\nthe Old World. Referring to themselves as the Enduring, these\nscattered communities of survivors huddle within reinforced\nbattlements where Sacred Pyres burn as a beacon of hope\nand safety. All Enduring are trained to survive and defend\nthemselves in this bleak land from a young age, many honed\ninto fierce warriors and Aetherweavers through hardship and\nnecessity by the time they reach adulthood. Bands of hunters\nbrave the cracked and twisted landscape beyond their walls\neach day to gather sustenance, recover materials, and connect\nor trade with other surviving settlements.\nHowever, many of the outside world’s wandering beasts have\nmutated from the corruption of the Umbra; this transient\nstorm of twisted souls merges with and contorts the creatures\ninto nightmarish monsters that stalk, rage, and evolve with\neach newly fused specter. When these monstrosities slay\nthose who confront the wilds, their victims’ blighted souls join\nthe horrors that claimed them. In the absence of the gods,\ndreams turn ominous and empty, and oracles imagine great\nalien minds glimpsing into this world, reaching beyond the\ncosmic veil left unguarded.\nThe diaspora of surviving communities hold against the doom\nthrough grit, ingenuity, and faith. Within the swampy flood\nplains of the mountain-crowned region known as the Idol\nHollows, an emergent fort village called Okros has stood\nresilient against the surrounding swampland dangers for\nover fifty years. Its massive walls of melted shields and stone\nencircle the village and central Sacred Pyre, whose flames\nclimb above the tallest ramparts, a burning symbol of strength\nand safety visible from across the Idol Hollows.\nA recent seismic event within the valley conjured a massive\nsinkhole referred to as the Shalk Chasm, uncovering an\nexpanse of long-buried structures and vestiges from before\nthe Old World. Concerned and curious about what boons\nor banes might await discovery within this subterranean\ncatacomb, brave Enduring slowly investigate the mysteries\nbelow, while scouts seek allies from erudite places, such as\nthe Celsians of Amber Reach.\nNestled against the Griefcleft Mountains that buttress the\neastern edge of the Idol Hollows, dividing it from the tainted\njungles of Aveidoora, the glorious city of Amber Reach lays\nfallen and haunted in the wake of the Apostasy. The once-\nprosperous capital’s expansive cityscape of overbearing\ngates, gothic towers, and staggering fortresses lies damaged\nand derelict, with empty households now sheltering horrors\nand looters. Within the city’s Ashcall Quarter, the Celsian\nAthenaeum, a grand college and library repurposed into a\nstronghold, still holds against the dark. Here, hundreds of\nEnduring work against the deadly spirits and ghastly killers\nthat torment the city ruins, seeking to reclaim control of\nAmber Reach’s streets. A rising faction of hedonic, ruthless\nscoundrels and raiders known as the Damask Queens expand\ntheir territory from the far side of the debris-strewn Cinnabar\nQuarter, their crossings with the Celsians growing more\nviolent with each encounter.\nAs despondent as existence may seem in the Halcyon Domain,\nwithin these communities of the Enduring, hope continuously\nsparks aflame. Whispers speak of remnants of divine power\nlingering within lost shrines and holy sites that can rebuke the\nsoul blight. Rumors spread between settlements of heroic\nfigures felling greater evils and reclaiming ancient relics for the\nmight of the Enduring. Spirited leaders and champions rouse\ntheir fellow Enduring with promises of expanding their walls\nand avenging their fallen. Zealot factions fervently seek means\nto commune with the absent gods, forever searching for ways\nto repent for Othedias’s crimes. Those who can access the\nAetherweave see visions of distant sanctums and uncorrupted\nfanes that cast aside the clouded skies to preserve light\nand life—or even redeem those touched by the soul blight.\nHermetic societies claim to carry tomes and truths of God-\nKing Othedias and his great tragedy, along with prophecies\nthat speak of a chance at salvation for the realm. The lands\nmay be dark, but the points of light burn ever so bright.\nTHE AGE OF UMBRA\n281\tChapter 5: The Age of Umbra\n\n-- 282 of 415 --\n\nCOMMUNITIES\nAll communities are available, but some have unique aspects within an Age of Umbra campaign. As needed, provide the following\ninformation to your players and choose one or more of the questions to ask them during your session zero.\nHighborne and Slyborne\nSome communities manage to carve out a surviving section\nof an Old World cityscape, reinforcing barricades and\nbattlements within a deadly urban ruin while enjoying the\nspoils of sacking the remnants of the past age’s high society.\nOthers were lucky enough to build a new township near a\nresource-rich location, where those who rose to power could\nenjoy an uncommon life of comparable luxury. It is in these\nplaces that factions of thieves and thugs thrive, whether in the\nemploy of the leadership, or by eroding them from below.\nHighborne communities within the Age of Umbra are\nextremely rare, and are often either based on the ghost of an\nOld World political power or a newly forged tyranny built on\nrecovered or stolen resources. Opulence in these dark times\nis scarce but hedonistic, reserved for those close to ruling\npowers and protected with promises of influence or threats of\nviolence.\n• Who are the leaders of your community, and how close are\nyou to their inner circles to have tasted the finer things in\nthis dire life?\n• How did you or your bloodline manage to accumulate\nenough resources or reputation to carve some influence\nwithin your community?\n• Among the upper echelon of your community, who do you\ntrust the most? Who do you trust the least?\nSlyborne characters are skulkers and thieves who flourish\nalongside those of influence or wealth across the land.\nWhether they work for highborne factions that try to maintain\npower or manipulate them for personal gain, those who know\nhow to remain unnoticed or unexploited excel at seizing\nopportunities. Many slyborne characters also make a name for\nthemselves as scouts or messengers between settlements,\ntrading in goods or rumors as they go. Others still could be\nmembers of roguish communities such as the Damask Queens\nof the Amber Reach, self-crowned leaders in the lawless echo\nof bygone power.\n• You’ve built a rapport with a highborne figure. Who are\nthey, and do you trust them, or are they just an easy mark?\n• Who among your community have you knowingly cheated,\nand are they aware?\n• You were part of a botched job not long ago, and the stain\nstill lingers on your reputation. What happened, and who\nwas at fault?\nLoreborne and Orderborne\nMany grandiose cities and centers of higher learning dotted\nthe Halcyon Domain during the prosperous previous age, but\nthese monuments are now ruled by cults of shattered will,\novertaken by monstrous entities, or lost to complete ruin.\nLoreborne and orderborne characters hail from a crumbling\nbastion of Old World academia, upholding aspects of this\nlost knowledge within their local community. Consider which\nfacets of the Old World they cling to and, if a character’s\ncommunity exists within the remains of a major Old World\ncity, which district of that city is important enough for the\nEnduring to make such a dangerous place home.\nLoreborne and orderborne communities typically rise within\nor near ancient libraries, temples, or other dilapidated urban\nenvironments where knowledge was once plentiful. Others\nmight have taken up in caverns and hidden places where\nrecovered historical records can be safeguarded and studied.\nA number of these factions remain obsessed with discovering\nthe truths of the ancient Grand Ordinants and Aetherlords,\nsuch as those who claim refuge in the Celsian Athenaeum.\n• What secret about the Old World have you been entrusted\nwith or discovered alongside your community?\n• How much of your community still remains? If it has fallen\ncompletely, what led to its destruction?\n• What heirloom of the Old World do you carry with you,\nand what is its significance to you?\n• What did you leave behind that still haunts you as you try\nto sleep?\nFor orderborne characters, players should consider the\nremnants of the Old World that still guide their character and\ntheir people through this ruined landscape, and how (if at all)\nyour ideologies might have changed in the face of a withering\nworld.\n• What tenets or virtues of your community have changed\nsince the Age of Umbra began? Which tenets do your\ncommunity hold on to unaltered, even if they no longer\napply to this broken world?\n• Which of your community’s tenets or virtues do you wish\nto embody and spread across the Halcyon Domain?\nTHE AGE OF UMBRA\n282 \tChapter 5: The Age of Umbra\n\n-- 283 of 415 --\n\nRidgeborne\nThe mountain ranges of the Halcyon Domain are varied,\nimposing, and prone to extended cold winds that carve the\nrock into jagged spires and winding valley clefts. Networks\nof ancient wood and stone bridges stretch across wide\ngaps in mountain passes, and the ones that haven’t fallen to\nweather or time become deeply important and well protected\nby the nearby ridgeborne communities that maintain them.\nHardened and sturdy people forged by the harsh environment,\nridgeborne characters might be scouts, hunters, or trade\nsentinels within their community. Some ridgeborne villages\nkeep vigil over mountainside tombs and sites of Old World\nknowledge, clinging to ancient oaths that fades more with\neach generation.\n• Who is a childhood friend or rival you formed a kinship\nwith? What task had them leave home a year ago, never to\nbe seen again?\n• What mountain predator’s call fills you with abject fear,\nand why?\n• One of your village elders entrusted you with an heirloom.\nWhat is it, and what or who did they request you keep it\nfrom?\nSeaborne\nThe scattering of coastal cities that still span the Halcyon\nDomain’s shores are defined by an existence straddling the\ndangerous waters of the Ashen Seas and the ever-expanding\nthreat of shadow that corrodes the land. Even so, these\ncommunities remain important places of commerce and\nresources, with mighty fishmongers and sailors battling the\nmasses of deadly threats from under the waves as they sail.\nStill, seaborne characters are often more carefree than others,\ntaking inspiration from the mercurial nature of their nearby\nlakes or seas in an otherwise dour world.\n• What is the one tale you’ve heard about the depths of the\nsea that still makes you nervous?\n• When you were younger, you swam deep beneath the\nwaters and encountered something unexpected. What\nwas it, and why does it wander back to your thoughts on\noccasion?\n• A traveler once came through your town and said\nsomething to you that shook you to your core. What was\nit, and what do you wish to tell them should you see them\nagain?\nUnderborne\nNumerous underground societies claimed space within\ncaverns beneath the surface, but only some of these\ncommunities have made contact with the surface since the\nabandonment of the gods. Some cavernous metropolises,\nnow half-buried by crumbling earth, fight to survive against\nthe terrors that stalk the underworld tunnels. Others build\nanew within the vacant remains of societies of yore, hoping to\nuncover secrets to better their fortunes.\nUnderborne characters could be scrappy scavengers and\ntomb delvers who feel at home in lightless, dust-filled spaces\naway from the tumultuous skies and flying nightmares of the\nsurface world. With the arrival of the Shalk Chasm, some\nunderborne communities might have been exposed to the\nsurface for the first time since the fall of the world.\n• When you are alone in quiet places, what sound do you\nbelieve you hear, and what do you think it means?\n• You’ve spent much of your upbringing within a reclaimed\nsubterranean structure. What was its original purpose,\nand what did you discover about it that you’ll never forget?\n• What is a place beneath your community that everyone\nknows to avoid at all costs? What happened when you\nsnuck into it when you were younger?\nWildborne\nThe natural world beyond any settlement’s walls is as\ndangerous and dark as it is expansive and beautiful.\nSprawling, haunted woodlands filled with deadly, mutated\nwildlife often hide vibrant glades of natural aether, where\nbioluminescent flora offers signs of solace or magical\nprotection against the consuming darkness. When a player\ncreates a wildborne character, they should consider how their\ncharacter’s homeland carved its place of peace among the\ntwisting vines and brambles. Some wildeborne societies of the\nOld World remain within their ancient fanes to hold hope for a\nbetter future, living symbiotically with the rare, uncorrupted\npockets of nature. Other wildborne communities stem from\nlost soldiers or fleeing survivors who the spirits of the wild\nprotect in their time of need.\n• What landmark within the forest has appeared in your\ndreams since childhood? What do you think it means?\n• Which nature spirit does your community rely on the most\nfor protection? What early signs of their corruption are you\nworried about?\n• What did you witness within the wilds that makes you fear\nyour home doesn’t have much time left?\nWanderborne\nMany wanderborne communities either flee destruction to\nstart anew elsewhere or uproot themselves frequently for fear\nof attracting the wilds’ worst horrors. Others might be made\nup of survivors with common purpose, a life where braving\nthe deadly chaos of the world is also a quest for answers. A\nwanderborne character might have spent their life on the run\ndue to circumstance or danger, or felt the subtle desperation\nof the realm and refused to sit still.\n• Why does your community keep picking up their roots and\nmoving on? What do some fear is following them each\ntime they do?\n• What is the one place you lived that you quietly wish you\ncould return to? What is there that still holds a place in\nyour heart?\n• You’ve had a recurring nightmare about a particular\nlocation. What about this place frightens you?\nTHE AGE OF UMBRA\n283\tChapter 5: The Age of Umbra\n\n-- 284 of 415 --\n\nANCESTRIES\nAll ancestries are available, but some have unique aspects\nwithin an Age of Umbra campaign. As needed, provide the\nfollowing information to your players.\nAll Ancestries\nConsider how the harsher setting and environment can\nintermingle with Daggerheart’s ancestries to inspire dark,\nweird, and unique interpretations.\nClanks\nClanks are often carved from stone and iron and were\noriginally developed as vessels for holy spirits and\nmessengers. Many stopped functioning and became statues\nwhen the gods left the Halcyon Domain.\nRibbets\nRibbets are large, often 6 to 8 feet tall, and prefer to skulk on\nall fours when not leaping or standing still.\nDrakona\nIn the Halcyon Domain, Drakona are taller and more reptilian\nin both physicality and proportions. They lean forward as they\nmove, using their tails to balance their weight.\nFaeries\nFaeries are more sensitive to the soul blight than other\nancestries, causing their physical appearance to develop in\njagged and monstrous ways.\nCLASSES\nAll classes are available, but some have unique aspects within\nan Age of Umbra campaign. As needed, provide the following\ninformation to your players.\nBards, Druids, Rogues, Rangers, Sorcerers,\nand Wizards\nThe forces of spellcraft and magic—especially dark magic—\nthat flow unseen through the world are referred to as the\nAetherweave, and those uncommon few who can manipulate\nit are known collectively as Aetherweavers. This art is difficult\nto teach to mortals, and they rarely wield it instinctively.\nWith many of these secrets lost with the previous age, the\npresence of an Aetherweaver is remarkable and often met\nwith awe, fear, and sometimes mistrust. Players who create\nan Aetherweaver should consider the responsibility they carry\nwith these gifts, and determine how brazenly they use these\nmystical abilities.\nSplendor Domain\nSince the gods’ abandonment and the fall of the Grand\nOrdinants, the great clerics of old, access to divine powers\nand healing rituals is a fading art. Many fear the very essence\nof such magic is dying with the light, so it is not uncommon\nfor some to foist sudden worship and expectation onto those\nwho display such gifts. However, while some see hope, others\nsee those with these abilities as an opportunity to express\ntheir hate for the absent gods. Seraphs and wizards who\ndisplay their Splendor domain abilities or spells might make a\nprofound impact or draw unwanted attention, depending on\ntheir current company. Players who create seraphs or wizards\nshould consider how open or guarded their character would be\nwith their abilities.\nTHE AGE OF UMBRA\n284 \tChapter 5: The Age of Umbra\n\n-- 285 of 415 --\n\nTHE AGE OF UMBRA\nPLAYER PRINCIPLES\nIf your group decides to play this campaign, give your players the following information before character creation.\nTreat Community as a Means of Survival\nYou have grown up in a world of despair, raised to rage against\nthe dying of the light. No matter the differences or challenges\nbetween you and others you meet, forging and protecting\nthe bonds of community close and abroad is a goal that\nsurmounts most others. If the Enduring cannot work together,\nthen all truly is lost.\nRemember That Not All Darkness Is Evil\nMost of the shadow that plagues this land is born out of\ntragedy, big and small. Keep in mind that many threats you\nface have a history—a sad and solemn story—that set\nthem on this terrible path. With the right inquisitiveness and\ncreativity, you can oftentimes parlay with or even redeem\nwhat hunts you before resorting to complete destruction.\nMany lost to the dark still retain some aspects of themselves\nto appeal to, and rumored magics could hold the key to\ncleansing elements of the Umbra’s corruption.\nEmbrace Lethality\nThe Age of Umbra is a realm of hardship, challenge, and loss,\nwhich allows for momentous revelations and incomparable\nvictories. Still, very few groups of heroes who venture out into\nthe Halcyon Domain carry any of the same faces when their\njourney is done. Find joy in the risks, relish the opportunities\nfor epic and memorable character deaths, and excitedly\ncreate new characters that the others can meet at the next\nencampment or landmark.\nConsider Your Role\nEveryone in this world is driven to survive, whether on their\nown or as part of a larger group. A character’s backstory\ncan define their previous role in this realm, the relationships\nthey’ve already established, and where they honed their\nknowledge and skills. For example, your character might\nhave been a hunter, scavenger, philosopher, storyteller,\noracle, scoundrel, leader, demagogue, or bandit before the\ncampaign begins. Do they continue to enjoy this role, or do\nthey yearn to reinvent themself in the dying light? How does\ntheir role define their goals for the future?\n285\tChapter 5: The Age of Umbra\n\n-- 286 of 415 --\n\nTHE AGE OF UMBRA\nGM PRINCIPLES\nKeep the following guidance in mind while you GM this campaign.\nRelish in the Omnipresent Threat\nEnjoy setting the scene for each ominous locale beyond the\nwalls of safety, weaving descriptions of solemn colors and the\ndark beauty of crumbled antiquity with the perpetual sense\nthat nowhere is truly safe. Many things go bump in the night,\nwhether or not the characters are in immediate danger, so\nbe willing to play with shadows, noises, and even monstrous\nshapes that lumber on the horizon just as your players grow\ncomfortable. When the time comes for a dangerous conflict,\nexemplify just how harrowing it is with baleful descriptions\nand menacing energy.\nShine Light in the Darkness Often\nEven as you thrill your players with epic displays of seemingly\ninsurmountable odds, deeply tragic narratives, and an ever-\noppressive, gloomy atmosphere, always strive to highlight\nopportunities for hope, joy, and victory. Be mindful of\nbalancing the starkly terrifying, bleak realm you’re navigating\ntogether with scattered locales of untainted beauty, moments\nof inspiring humanity, and chances to truly make a difference\nfor a better and brighter future. The highest highs leave room\nfor the most memorable lows, and vice versa.\nEmphasize Compassion Amidst Hardship\nWhen society is challenged with facing annihilation, the\ncommunity often comes together in passionate and wonderful\nways. Create and allow room for story moments where the\ndowntrodden and fearful find courage and strength in their\nfellow survivors and rise to the occasion. Let the people who\nfight to endure alongside the player characters be vulnerable\nwith them, share their fears and aspirations, forge bonds with\nthe characters, and express why they may invest their future\nin the characters’ actions.\nCreate Many Goals Across the Many Minds\nThis realm of darkness breeds a plethora of aspirations. The\nneed to survive in a harsh world can forge deeply conflicted\nand complicated personalities, ranging from the genuinely\naltruistic to the deeply selfish, and sometimes both. Consider\nthe wide range of communities, factions, and influential NPCs\nand how they’ve adapted to this dire age. Some may wish to\ncarve a sanctuary for their people, some may embrace the\nchaos to indulge in their worst impulses, some may place\ntheir hopes in uncovering ancient secrets, and some may be\ndriven only by sorrow and vengeance. Everything, even the\nterrible beasts and malformed fallen that haunt these lands,\nhas a wish and a story that drives them, as futile as some may\nseem.\nBuild Combat as a Test, a Puzzle, and a Journey\nThere are many deadly and terrifying entities throughout the\nHalcyon Domain, and sometimes a grand old throwdown\nto test the characters’ mettle is a thrilling experience for\nall involved. Even so, much of what is so monstrous in this\nrealm has become so through corruption, guilt, exploitation,\nor circumstance. Bringing a bit of pathos and humanity to\nsome threats can lead to a deliciously conflicted showdown,\nand might guide the players to consider other means to\nvictory than just slaughter. Pay some mind to alternative\nvictory conditions that you can tease out through adversary\nbehavior, environmental descriptions, historical recollection,\nor dialogue. If the players start developing a unique theory on\nhow to cleanse, befriend, or absolve their foe of their violent\nviews in ways you hadn’t accounted for, be open to following\nthe logic and excitement of that narrative thread and ask\nthe players questions that can help you explore that avenue\ntogether.\n286 \tChapter 5: The Age of Umbra\n\n-- 287 of 415 --\n\nTHE AGE OF UMBRA\nDISTINCTIONS\nUse this information to prepare your campaign. You can also share it with your players as needed.\nEternal Gloom and Volatile Weather\nSince the Veiled Gods abandoned the world, an endless gloom\nhas engulfed the skies, leaving the nights black as pitch and\neven the zenith of day a dreary haze. The somber grays of\nthe mist and sky are occasionally broken by heavy rains or\nstrange, erratic weather events, while the more cursed regions\nare home to never-ending storms of vibrant hues. Some say\neven underground, cavernous spaces are occasionally host to\nstrange weather phenomena.\nThis gloom only ever breaks over hallowed grounds or on\nmysterious, unpredictable days, revealing golden sunbeams or\ngossamer moonlight that grants esoteric boons (or curses) to\nthose present. There are beliefs among the Enduring that the\nhighest mountain peaks can pierce the gloom and offer new\nhomelands free of turmoil.\nDeath Becomes a Curse\nThe places not protected by the Sacred Pyres are vulnerable\nto the Umbra, the flow of malevolent, unholy spirits that cling\nto lightless spaces. This amorphous necrotic energy courses\nthrough the Halcyon Domain like a dark wind, transient\nand with unknowable intelligence, as it calls to the souls of\nthe dead like a mother to its children and draws them into\nits shape. The Umbra is a terrifying force of malice and\ncorruption, a swirling, wailing black mist invoking delirium\nand despair at its threshold while physically corrupting and\ntransforming the bodies of those that surrender to it.\nMany of the horrifying monsters prowling these lands have\nbeen changed by the Umbra, leaving part of its ever-expanding\nmass within them like a foul seed, mutating the host and\nperpetuating its own cancerous expansion through wanton\ndestruction and death. Those who live with the Umbra\nwithin them are but a shade of their former selves, taken to\nextreme emotion and fractured memory. Now twisted into\nan abominable form and warped with the features of others\nlost to the Umbra, these victims malevolently lash out at\nany pinprick of life and light. While whispers spread of those\nwho have been cleansed of the Umbra’s touch, for most they\nremain just that—whispers.\nThe Rarity of Respite\nEverywhere the gloom touches, danger lurks. Ancient evils\nthrive in this age of shadow, while warped spirits marked\nby the soul blight mingle and corrupt whatever they can\nsubsume. Those who persist must seek the rare, scattered\nplaces of safety and respite: where a Sacred Pyre burns.\nThese hallowed fires were lit by the waning conclave of\nOrdinants before they vanished, and their flames are one of\nthe few wonders that keep the horrors of the Umbra at bay\n(see the upcoming “Campaign Mechanics” section).\nThe Enduring formed communities around many of these\nPyres and kindle them daily for fear of them dying out, while\nsmaller consecrated embers are said to persist undiscovered\nin distant places, in danger of going cold. But even still, the\nEnduring must take heed: not all evil is repelled by the Pyres’\nflickering light.\nThe Shadow of Society\nThe Old World was one of grandiose castle fortresses,\nsprawling cityscapes, and imposing temples towering over the\nlush lands that surrounded them. However, the wrath of the\nVeiled Gods toppled much of that extravagance to ruin, the\nkingdoms and cabals that basked in opulence shattered and\nforgotten.\nWhat remains is a ghost of what once was. Surviving\nremnants of the old ways struggle to reclaim a forgotten glory\nwhile most survivors lead grueling lives across the splintered\ncommunities of this broken realm. This tattered tapestry of\nheritage and history is fading with the light, yet the Enduring\nforge new culture through hardship, determination, and\nambition, picking through the debris of what was in hopes of\nbuilding what will be.\nMagic Is Suspicious\nIn ancient times, the practice of Aetherweaving was\nparamount to the Halcyon Domain’s construction and\nprosperity. Yet, while rune-marked arms and enchanted relics\nof the Old World are considered boons by the surviving people\nof the Halcyon Domain, the Aetherweave is believed to be\nresponsible for the wrath of the Veiled Gods, and thus the Age\nof Umbra.\nMuch of the world is now suffused in dark magic that\nsaturates the wilds, chaotic and corrupting, wielded by those\nwho worship the gloom of the new age or yield entirely to it.\nThe superstitious disdain for spellcraft is pervasive within\nmany communities, with tales of Aetherweaver hubris taught\nas fables to youth to dissuade them from such temptation.\nPlaces that harbor lingering fonts of magic are instinctively\nshunned and avoided by many. While Aetherweaving can be\nused to protect and preserve, it is deeply mistrusted in many\nsocial circles, leading to confrontation or exile if care is not\ntaken.\n287\tChapter 5: The Age of Umbra\n\n-- 288 of 415 --\n\nTHE AGE OF UMBRA\nTHE INCITING INCIDENT\nYou can use the prompt below to start your campaign, or\ncreate your own.\nRecently, one of Okros’s hunting bands, led by Huntmaster\nEvrados (ridgeborne giant, he/him), delved into the Shalk\nChasm in search of resources. There, they stumbled upon\nan eroded, forgotten temple to an obscure Veiled God. The\nhuntmaster was caught by a monster and dragged into the\ndepths of the temple, and though the remaining three hunters\nsought to find him, a terrible odor forced them to withdraw\nout of fear and revulsion.\nWhen the band returned to the settlement and shared\nthe news, Elder Akadona (wanderborne orc, she/her) and\nthe village speakers debated the best course of action.\nTheir heated dispute was interrupted—by Evrados’s voice\nscreaming for help from beyond the walls of the camp. Though\nscouts couldn’t see Evrados in the murky swamp, the hunting\nband left the light of the Pyre to rush to their huntmaster’s\naid. The screams mercifully halted for a time.\nThen the screams broke out again, Evrados’s lament joined by\nthe wails of his hunters.\nThe denizens of Okros are now terrified, the unsettling din\nheightening their agitation and fear. The shrieking doesn’t\nchange or wane over time, further exemplifying the unearthly\nnature of their cries. Desperate for an answer, Elder Akadona\nhas gathered the party and requested that they investigate\nwhat happened to the huntmaster and his crew, seeking to\nsave them if possible, and end their suffering if not.\nThe gates of the settlement are opened, revealing the forlorn\nwillows and mist-choked wetland valley beyond. The party\nmust investigate the source of these cries for help and\nattempt to recover Okros’s lost hunters. However, what\nmonster is responsible, and how do they steal the voices\nof those missing? What is the monster’s connection to the\nuncovered temple, and if they recoil back into their lair, what\ndangers lie within? Are Huntmaster Evrados and his team\nbeyond rescue? What other macabre revelations might require\nreaching out to another settlement?\nCAMPAIGN MECHANICS\nThe following mechanics are unique to this campaign.\nThe Strength of Hate\nThe Umbra can seep into all manner of beings, twisting them\ninto a malformed mockery of their former selves instilled with\npreternatural strength.\nAdversaries and environments in this campaign can gain an\nadditional type called Umbra-Touched. When an adversary is\nUmbra-Touched, describe how the Umbra has warped their\nessence and form. All Umbra-Touched adversaries critically\nsucceed on attacks against a PC on a die roll of 19–20.\nAs the PCs gain scars, they themselves become slowly\ncorrupted by the Umbra. When a PC deals damage, they\ndeal extra damage equal to their number of scars. When a\nPC marks their last Hope slot with a scar, they don’t retire,\ninstead succumbing to the Umbra’s influence and charging\nforever into the dark to join the terrors that stalk lightless\nspaces.\nFiery Beacons\nEvery surviving settlement within the Halcyon Domain\nhuddles around the relative safety of a Sacred Pyre, a vibrantly\nburning flame that is sparked by a Blessed Branch and\ncontinuously kindled by those given the mantle of Pyrekeeper.\nBlessed Branches are a rare and hallowed artifact carried\nas reliquaries by those who wish to expand the reach of the\nEnduring and found new encampments.\nIf the characters acquire a Blessed Branch, they can reignite\nan extinguished Sacred Pyre or create a new Sacred Pyre that\nstands as a bastion of warmth and safety.\nBLESSED BRANCH\nAn ashen relic from the Old World that carries a splinter of\ndivinity. When ignited, all Enduring present gain 3 Hope, and\nthe flame it emits repels all but the most powerful monsters\nfrom its immediate vicinity as long as it burns. Only a bit of\nkindling must be provided daily to maintain this slow-burning\nblaze.\n288 \tChapter 5: The Age of Umbra\n\n-- 289 of 415 --\n\nTHE AGE OF UMBRA\nLurking Darkness\nThe Lurking Darkness represents the ever-present dangers of\nthe Umbra. When the party finishes a short or long rest while\nnot in the vicinity of a Sacred Pyre, roll a d12 for the Lurking\nDarkness and consult the following list:\n1–2: \tDescribe how something monstrous found them\nin the dark. An adversary of the GM’s choice initiates\nconflict.\n3–5: \tDescribe how something terrifying stalks nearby.\nYou gain 2 Fear.\n6–9: \tDescribe how the imposing darkness intensifies.\nYou gain a Fear.\n10–11: Describe how the characters rest undisturbed.\nNo effect.\n12: \tDescribe how the characters stumble upon a hopeful\nomen. Each PC gains a Hope.\nWith danger ever abounding, those who brave the shadowed\nwilds can keep watch in hopes of preventing the terrors of the\nUmbra from finding them. Parties have access to an additional\ndowntime move:\nKeep Watch: Describe how you stay vigilant against what\nlurks beyond your camp. When the GM makes a Lurking\nDarkness roll at the end of downtime, you roll your Hope\nDie and choose whether to replace their roll with yours.\nIf multiple players choose this move, you can take the\nhighest die roll.\nSoul Blight\nIf a humanoid NPC or any PC dies, the GM can spend a Fear\nto immediately raise them as a Shambling Zombie—or 2 Fear\nto raise them as a Brawny Zombie—who tirelessly seeks to\nkill everyone they once cared for. Once their zombie form has\nbeen destroyed, the victim’s blighted soul withdraws and\njoins the Umbra. Their features can appear on future\nUmbra-Touched adversaries.\nSESSION ZERO QUESTIONS\nAsk any of these questions to your players, or make your own.\n• If members of the party hail from different communities,\nwhy did they leave, and what called them to this particular\nsettlement? Do their home communities still exist? What\nrumors and mysteries surrounding or permeating their\ncommunities still linger in their minds?\n• Are any characters burdened with burgeoning oracle\nsight? If so, what visions have begun to creep into their\nsleep?\n• What do your characters see when they stare into the inky\nvoid of night too long?\n• How deadly does the group wish this campaign to be?\nWould you enjoy a possible churn of many character\ndeaths across a campaign, or do you want a more\nbalanced flow where danger is real, but not stacked so\nhard against you?\n289\tChapter 5: The Age of Umbra\n\n-- 290 of 415 --\n\nMOTHERBOARD\nIn a world where magic takes the form of the technology left behind by a long-fallen civilization, a\nnew threat rises as a malicious virus spreads through the machines that wander the Wastes.\nBy Meguey Baker, Rowan Hall, & Spenser Starke\nComplexity Rating: •••\nTHE PITCH\nRead this section to your players to introduce them to the\ncampaign.\nAmong the ancient ruins of the fallen world, the great walled\ncities of the Echo Vale sit as bastions of hope in an otherwise\nhostile land. Utilizing technology powered by a mysterious\nlanguage that runs through metal threads tethered high\nabove the valley, these citadels insulate their citizens from\nthe Wastes, where autonomous machines roam wild and\nmassive wandering cities scour the land for scrap. But when a\nmalicious virus infects the machine beasts that work alongside\nthe people of the valley, the once-docile creations turn violent.\nIn a Motherboard campaign, you’ll use technology instead of\nmagic as you play extraordinary heroes leaving the safety of\nthe walled cities to travel the Wastes and bring peace to the\nVale once more.\nTONE & FEEL\nAdventurous, Epic, Innovative, Mysterious,\nPost-Post-Apocalyptic, Technological\nTHEMES\nArtificial Intelligence, Identity & Personhood, Innovation,\nTechnology vs. Humanity\nTOUCHSTONES\nHorizon Zero Dawn, Mortal Engines, Mad Max: Fury Road,\nThe Final Fantasy Series, Fullmetal Alchemist, Slugblaster\n290 \tChapter 5: Motherboard\n\n-- 291 of 415 --\n\nOVERVIEW\nIf your group decides to play this campaign, give your players the following information before character creation.\nThe Echo Vale is so named because its people live among the\nremains—the “echoes”—of a fallen civilization and attempt to\nuse ancient technology for new purposes. In the hundreds of\nyears since the fallen ones’ mysterious annihilation, the steel\nand concrete of the old world succumbed to the plants and\nanimals of the valley. Grasses grew in the cracks of ancient\nroads, trees made homes in derelict skyscrapers, and history\nforgot the names of figures depicted in crumbling statues,\nleaving those who built homes in the husks of these once-great\ncities to muddle their way through the powerful programs and\nmachines left behind.\nNow, formidable settlements such as Argent make home\namong decaying ruins, building walls to keep violence out and\nworkers in. Meanwhile, Carrowcroft Walkaway and other\nwandering cities move through the valley on all manner of\nvehicles, towns atop lumbering machines like travelers hauling\ntheir packs.\nAbove the valley lies the Network, a dense web of glimmering\nmetal wire that shepherds information and communication\nacross the disparate cities of the Echo Vale. Though the\nvalley’s inhabitants have long used this ancient technology, the\ncomplex language used to create and modify the network was\nlost when the previous civilization fell.\nThroughout the Echo Vale roam autonomous machines of the\nfallen world, called remnants. These automatons come in two\nprimary forms. Some resemble animals, with features that\nmatch their living counterparts. Others were designed with\na function in mind, such as defenders, builders, watchers,\nor domestic laborers that carried out tasks alongside their\nlong-dead creators. Some remnants live within cities and are\nconsidered “tame,” while others roam “wild” in the Wastes,\noften territorial and hunting for sources of energy. Some are\nlarge enough to hold entire wandering cities on their backs,\nwhile others are small creatures that serve no apparent\nfunction aside from supplying scrap parts for the working\nmachines people need to use each day.\nThese machines gain energy from a variety of sources.\nRemnants are drawn to power and information like organic\nanimals to food; while tame remnants can gather theirs\nfrom connections to the Networks within cities, their wild\ncounterparts must resort to other means. Remnants can\nproduce energy through photosynthesis, kill other remnants\nfor their power stores, or hunt people to siphon their energy.\nThey act like other wild animals—always focused on their next\nmeal, whatever they must do to get it. Rumors say that some\nwild remnants are able to harvest information from the brains\nof the creatures they kill.\nThe Wastes are the overgrown, hostile lands between cities\nthat are filled with wild remnants and ancient ruins. The\naverage citizen spends most of their life within a walled or\nwandering city, but needs arise that require trips out into\nthe Wastes. City defenders must stop attacks from wild\nremnants, messengers run between cities when portions of\nthe Network need repair, and some cities rely on hunting\nparties for food. Out in the Wastes, travelers and remnants\nalike can still access the Network through free data wells.\nTo access the vast information left behind by the ancient\nworld, inhabitants both mortal and machine use the ports\nat the base of data wells, slender towers that reach up to\nthe lines of the Network. Data wells can be found across the\nvalley, but many exist within walled cities, rendering them\ninaccessible to the rest of the region. The wells in the Wastes\nthat remain freely available become hotbeds of violence, as\nwild remnants use them like a watering hole for power and\ninformation. In contrast, the Pilgrims of the Spire are a group\nknown to strongly value and protect free data wells, as they’re\nconsidered sacred places connected to the Motherboard.\nMOTHERBOARD\n291\tChapter 5: Motherboard\n\n-- 292 of 415 --\n\nThe tallest spire at the center of the Echo Vale is the\nMotherboard, from which all threads of the Network\noriginate. Though no one has ever been able to enter this\ndaunting tower, each city has their own beliefs about its\nancient power. Most citizens revere the massive presence\nwithin as a god, believing it was worshipped by the fallen\ncivilization and carries their wisdom forward to bless today’s\ninformation-scarce world. Others believe it is a “master\nprogram” the technomancers of the fallen world left behind,\nand is therefore as fallible as any other remnant. Though\nthe Motherboard herself does not communicate with\npeople directly, she shepherds all data and power through\nthe Network. Without her operating system, the valley’s\ntechnology would eventually fail. Despite what is commonly\nbelieved, some technomancers and pilgrims claim to speak to\nthe Motherboard in the machine language, known as “kohd.”\nTechnomancers are the datacrafters who utilize ancient\nmachines for new purposes. Historians work to decipher\nkohd, while practitioners work directly with remnants and\nother technology to gain a deeper understanding of this\narcane language. Some forgo study of kohd entirely in favor of\nsimply utilizing machines for their power. Most have a general\nunderstanding of how to employ the effects of the fallen\nworld’s technology, allowing them to operate and control its\npowerful programs, even without understanding its inner\nworkings. Because this tech isn’t fully understood by the\npeople of the modern age, technomancers can manage only\ntemporary repairs on the remnants.\nMachinists are more focused on the physical aspects of\nremnants. Many of them work in factories or scrap works,\nrepairing gears, wires, and processors for a variety of\nmachines, including remnants and mechanicals (operator-\ndriven machines). Some machinists can cobble together new\nremnants from spare parts, but they must use old remnant\ncores from the fallen world to give them life. Stories tell of\nwild remnants creating more of their own kind, but most\nconsider these myths told by travelers.\nRecently, a disaster occurred known as the Remnant’s\nFury—a virus spread through the Network that caused the\nremnants to attack in the dead of night. These machines,\nwhich once worked peacefully in homes and businesses,\nassailed hundreds of unsuspecting people in both walled and\nwandering cities. In the Wastes, travelers found themselves\nsuddenly facing particularly violent packs of wild remnants.\nAutonomous machines have always posed unique dangers—\nworking remnants short out, wild remnants kill for energy—\nbut this was different. This was a massacre.\nMore and more remnants are becoming violent, and those\nwho live under the Network must figure out what to do before\nthe Echo Vale meets a fate like the fallen world. No one knows\nwho or what caused the malicious virus taking hold of the\nremnants, but for it to be this widespread, there’s growing\ncertainty that it must somehow involve the Motherboard.\nCOMMUNITIES\nAll communities are available, but some have unique aspects\nwithin a Motherboard campaign. As needed, provide the\nfollowing information to your players and choose one or more\nof the questions to ask them during your session zero.\nLoreborne\nMany loreborne communities are devoted to the history of\nthe fallen world and the technology they left behind, whether\nspiritually or practically. Loreborne characters could be\nexperts in the machine workings of mechanicals or remnants,\ntechnomancers attempting to use kohd, or academics\nstudying the history of the fallen civilization. If they have\ncareers in any of these fields, they’ll be highly sought after\nwherever they go.\n• You discovered something about the fallen ones you’ve\nnever shared with anyone. What secret do you keep?\n• You’ve trained as a technomancer for many years, but one\nthing baffles you about the remnants. What is it?\n• You have a trick to get any machine up and running. What\ndo you do, and who taught it to you?\nMOTHERBOARD\n292 \tChapter 5: Motherboard\n\n-- 293 of 415 --\n\nOrderborne\nIn the Echo Vale, most orderborne characters belong to a\ngroup focused on protecting a larger community. They might\ndefend a walled or wandering city, or work as contractors\nhired to hunt and scrap remnants in the Wastes. These\ncharacters use their skills for a price—sometimes the benefits\nare housing, other times scrap parts, or simply profit. Groups\nassociated with a city often have regimented operations,\nwhile contractors who travel the valley are more likely to have\nunique systems and skills.\n• You were once a member of a small group of contractors,\nbut now you’re stationed in the Argent guard. What made\nyou choose to stay within the walls?\n• You have a trick for catching and scrapping wild remnants\nthat city officials pay handsomely for. What is it, and who\ntaught it to you?\n• A loved one was badly injured in an accident during a scrap\nrun. What happened, and why do you feel it was your fault?\nRidgeborne\nThe mountains bordering the valley support the spider-like\nweb of the Network, making their peaks neutral territory. All\ncities are expected to contribute citizens to the Tower Watch,\nan independent group who tends to the towers and wires and\nprotects the Network from the effects of wildlife and weather.\nPlayers might choose the ridgeborne community if they want\nto build a character who belongs to the Tower Watch or one\nof the smaller wandering or walled cities that make a home on\nthe cliffs for safety.\n• Do you consider yourself at home in the lower valley? Why\nor why not?\n• There is a secret that only the Tower Watch knows. What\nis it?\n• You once saw someone fall from a tower into the Wastes\nbelow. What led to this?\nWanderborne\nWanderborne characters may be worshippers of the\nMotherboard who identify as Pilgrims of the Spire. These\ndevotees leave the cities to traverse the Wastes, facing wild\nremnants and violent travelers to reach the central spire.\nThough the tower is sealed to entrants, other worshippers\nestablish large camps at its base and attempt to connect to\nthe “voice of the Mother.”\n• You’re certain you once heard the voice of the\nMotherboard. What did she tell you?\n• You don’t believe the Motherboard is a god, but you\ntraveled with the Pilgrims anyway. Why?\n• The Pilgrims of the Spire protect a secret. What is it?\nOther wanderborne characters are citizens of a roaming\ncity. These civilizations range in size from only a few homes\nto massive metropolises that move through the Wastes.\nWandering cities eschew walls, favoring movement as a\nmeans of protection from remnants and other dangers. Some\nwandering cities are built on mechanicals and must be driven\nor controlled by people, while others are built on the backs\nof giant remnants. After the Remnant’s Fury, the wandering\ncities atop remnants were forced into a dangerous position: if\nthey can’t keep their remnant pacified, they risk losing not just\ntheir home, but their entire community.\n• You were part of the team that cares for your city’s giant\nremnant. What do you know about its personality that\nothers don’t?\n• You were training to pilot your wandering city’s\nmechanical, but you left to live somewhere else. What\nhappened that drove you out?\n• Your wandering city’s remnant follows the same path\nthrough the valley and will not stray from it. Why is this?\nUnderborne\nThe fallen ones not only paved the valley in pliable gray stone,\nthey also dug into the earth and created labyrinthine buildings\nunderground. Underborne characters are likely members\nof communities that avoid the danger and strife of the\nvalley above in the dark and twisting passages below. These\nunderground cities fiercely protect their few aboveground\nentry points, but they still face danger from remnants\nthat can dig beneath the earth—in particular, underborne\ncommunities are often threatened by old farming remnants\noperating in the wild.\n• The buildings that make up your underground community\nonce had a unified purpose. What do you believe this\npurpose was?\n• Members of your community have a unique way of\ndispatching remnants underground. How do they\naccomplish this?\n• Your community protects something important. What is it?\nMOTHERBOARD\n293\tChapter 5: Motherboard\n\n-- 294 of 415 --\n\nANCESTRIES\nSome ancestries are not available for a Motherboard\ncampaign. As needed, provide the following information to\nyour players.\nClanks\nClanks are unavailable in a Motherboard campaign. All\nautonomous robotic beings are remnants, and though they\nhave many unique forms, none have sapience.\nMagical Ancestries\nSome ancestries in Daggerheart have inherent magical\nfeatures, like the Drakona’s Elemental Breath. Consider how\nthese would manifest in a world where magic comes from\ntechnology, then adapt the flavor of each feature accordingly.\nCLASSES\nAll classes are available, but some have unique aspects within\na Motherboard campaign. As needed, provide the following\ninformation to your players.\nAll Classes with Spellcasting\nRather than magic, characters who use a Spellcasting trait\ninstead utilize technology to carry out their abilities. Some\ncome to technomancy through years of study, while others\nfeel an innate call to the ancient ways. Characters with a\nspellcasting trait should decide how they utilize technology\nto mirror spellcraft and consider what tools, processes, or\nsystems they need to accomplish their goals.\nSorcerers & Wizards\nSince magic is technology in this campaign, sorcerers are\nbiohackers that incorporate technology into their physical\nform, whereas wizards tinker with what they find and combine\nprograms and machines together to build something new.\nDruids\nWhen druids transform into a Beastform, it wraps around\nthem as a mechanized suit that can enhance their senses,\nchange the way they move, or grant them unique abilities. A\ndruid’s Beastform can look similar to the remnants of the Echo\nVale or more closely resemble living animals.\nMOTHERBOARD\n294 \tChapter 5: Motherboard\n\n-- 295 of 415 --\n\nBeastbound Rangers\nIn a Motherboard campaign, a Beastbound ranger’s\ncompanion can be a living creature, but organic fauna\nare considered both rare and valuable within the cities.\nAlternatively, they may have developed a close relationship\nwith a remnant.\nOPTIONAL RULE: CORRUPTION TRACK\nIf a Beastbound ranger has a remnant companion, they can\nuse the following rules to make the remnant subject to the\nsame threat of corruption from the Remnant’s Fury.\nRecord the following Corruption track on the Companion\nsheet. At the beginning of downtime, the ranger rolls their\nFear Die. If it lands on a 1, they must mark a Corruption\nand describe the temporary glitch that overcomes their\ncompanion.\nCorruption Track: \nSpecialized technomancers may be able to temporarily\nrepair the remnant (which clears 1d4 Corruption), but the\nonly way to truly save them is to stop the malicious virus\ncoming from the Motherboard. If the companion’s last\nCorruption is ever marked, the remnant becomes violent\nand can no longer be commanded or repaired. The ranger\nmust take a new companion with two new Experiences.\nThey carry over the same number of level-up options\nthey’ve already chosen to this new companion.\nSeraphs\nGenerally, seraphs worship the Motherboard as their god,\nkohd as a holy language, and treat the many programs and\npieces of technology that come from them as power imparted\nby their faith. Others believe there are many gods, known as\nthe Faint Divinities, that live within the Network, shifting their\npresence to different areas across the vale as needed. Players\nshould determine why their character relates to technology\non a spiritual level, rather than simply employing it. They\nshould also consider if and how they offer their devotion to the\nMotherboard or Faint Divinities.\nWarriors\nThe warrior’s “Combat Training” feature is replaced with the\nfollowing new feature:\nIkonis Training: You start with one Force augment already\ncrafted and installed in your Ikonis.\nFor more information on Ikonis, see the “Campaign\nMechanics” section on page 301.\nMOTHERBOARD\n295\tChapter 5: Motherboard\n\n-- 296 of 415 --\n\nPLAYER PRINCIPLES\nIf your group decides to play this campaign, give your players the following information before character creation.\nReplace Magic with Technology\nIn a Motherboard campaign, all magic is technology. When\nyour character casts spells, consider how the effect manifests\nin this world. Each time they use a weapon, consider how\nto align it with the repurposed and rebuilt technology of the\nfallen world.\n• Does your character wear gauntlets with a screen that\nallows them to scroll through their grimoire? Does their\nstaff crackle with electricity?\n• How do they store information from the network when\nthey aren’t connected?\n• Do they have personal or shared devices that can be\nloaded with a variety of information types? How is this\ndone? Do they use discs, drives, or plugs?\nContrast the Technological with the Emotional\nWhile the Echo Vale is filled with exciting technologies and\nunique adaptations, it’s also filled with people experiencing\nhardship, fear, and love. As your character travels through the\nvalley, fighting remnants and political adversaries, consider\nhow the wider story affects them personally. Each time your\ncharacter interacts with new people and technology, consider\nhow they feel about them and take action based on their\nemotional response.\n• How does your character feel about the power of the\nMotherboard?\n• Has your character ever formed a close connection with a\nremnant?\n• How does your character’s history influence their\ninteractions with particular cities or individuals?\nCreate a Shared Language\nThe Echo Vale is built atop an ancient society that perished\nlong ago. The lifestyle and language of the fallen ones was\nincredibly advanced, yet it still remains obscure to the\nEcho Vale’s modern people. It’s up to you to make a shared\nlexicon to describe the technology they use, working with\nthe table to determine what your characters do and do\nnot understand about the fallen world. This includes the\nterminology, application, and meaning of places and objects.\nYour characters may use a language that developed from the\none spoken and written by their predecessors, but they’ll likely\nhave a different understanding of words because they lack\nnecessary context. Similarly, their people might have ascribed\nmeaning and function to objects with an entirely different\noriginal purpose.\n• What items from the old world were made of materials\nstrong enough to survive the test of time? If portions of an\nobject degraded, what remained?\n• How much of an object’s original function is known to the\npeople? Have they adapted items to a new purpose?\n• Have they assigned spiritual value to mundane objects?\nDo they use items that were once culturally significant for\nmundane tasks?\n• What words have a different meaning to today’s people\nthan they originally carried in the fallen world?\nMOTHERBOARD\n296 \tChapter 5: Motherboard\n\n-- 297 of 415 --\n\nGM PRINCIPLES\nKeep the following guidance in mind while you GM this campaign.\nFill the World with the Ruins of Technology\nBecause the innovation of the fallen ones was so advanced,\nthe people who live in the Echo Vale today have molded their\nlives around the technology that remains. Even so, they don’t\nunderstand it well enough to rebuild the systems that gave\nthe fallen world its immense power. Fill the world with the\nruins of state-of-the-art buildings and machines, weather them\nwith centuries of nature’s intrusion, and then describe the\nless-advanced world built among them. You may also want to\ndecide what led to the downfall of the past civilization, then\nuse that to flavor the world they left behind.\n• What does the wreckage of a strip mall look like with a\nsmall encampment of wooden homes built within?\n• What particular pieces of technology have people been\nable to keep running? How have they adapted them?\nAdditionally, you’re encouraged to reflavor Daggerheart\nadversaries as remnants.\n• How would an adversary’s abilities manifest if they were\nmade of circuits and steel? How does their appearance\nchange? Do they have different motivations?\nMake the Details Fantastical and the Conflicts\nGrounded\nThough the Echo Vale is filled with fantastical technology\nthat causes large-scale problems, each confrontation should\ncenter the struggles of its people, be they cultural, political,\nor spiritual. Use technology as window dressing for grounded\nconflict to blend the exciting details of the campaign with\npersonal stakes for each character. You can use the abilities\nof remnants and the aspects of cities as allegories for\nthe emotional experiences of the party. For example, if a\nmember of the party recently lost a family member, you could\nintroduce them to an NPC in the Wastes who’s protecting a\nremnant they were raised alongside, despite the fact that its\nrecent corruption has caused it to become violent.\n• How does the use of technology highlight a conflict\nbetween individuals or groups?\n• What remnants can act as physical representations of\nemotional turmoil?\nPit Tradition Against Progress\nThere are numerous conflicting ideologies among the cities\nand travelers of the Echo Vale, but most can be distilled into\ntwo schools of thought: Some people want to reject their\npredecessor’s technology, allowing the people of today the\nchance to define themselves and make their own way in this\nnew world. Others believe they must dig further into the past\nto harness the powerful machines the fallen world left behind.\n• How do these opposing viewpoints come into conflict?\n• How do the political and social conflicts affect characters\npersonally?\nMOTHERBOARD\n297\tChapter 5: Motherboard\n\n-- 298 of 415 --\n\nDISTINCTIONS\nUse this information to prepare your campaign. You can also share it with your players as needed.\nTechnomancy\nImagine trying to explain our modern technology to our\ndistant ancestors—it would seem like magic. This is how\ntechnology from the fallen world should be engaged with and\ndescribed by the people of the Echo Vale. Reading the ancient\nlanguage of kohd and pressing buttons on screens to perform\nsupernatural feats is impossible without the Network. People\nwho use technology are known as technomancers, and the\nway they use technology is only limited by your and your\nplayers’ imaginations. Consider how this prowess will look for\neach player character and NPC, allowing the technological to\nbecome extraordinary.\nThe Fallen World\nThe fallen ones were a powerful people who developed the\nvery systems that likely destroyed them, but the world they\nleft behind is as rich as it is obscure. The shimmering wire\nNetwork overhead, steel skyscrapers, concrete buildings, and\nmachines with their own consciousness fill the Echo Vale even\nas nature works to reclaim it. Here, rivers pass through cities,\nbuildings fill with new growth, and ancient monitors hang on\nthe wall like panes of shattered glass.\nScrap Operations\nBecause the modern world is built on an ancient civilization’s\nruins, it relies on the scraps they left behind. Thus, there is a\nunique economy and set of terms built around the concept of\nscraps.\nScrap operations often begin with the salvagers, those brave\nenough to venture out into the wastes to unearth ancient\ntechnology and hunt remnants for their parts. Those who\nsurvive stand to earn considerable commission depending\non what they bring back and where they sell it. Some cities\nonly want replacement parts for their remnants, while others\nsearch for artifacts of historical significance.\nWithin the cities, scrappers process and sell parts for\nmechanical repair and technomancy. Scrap shacks are the\n(often illegal) businesses run by individuals, but some cities\nrequire that all machine parts pass through government hands\nbefore going to the individual market.\nThose who work with remnants or practice technomancy\nmight adopt a variety of terms. Mechanists and scrap hackers\nrepair or rebuild machines, autonomous or otherwise, while\nthe technomancers who work with datacraft might be called\ntechs.\nQuantum\nQuantum is the currency that runs the Echo Vale’s economy.\nHow much quantum a person has is generally stored on a\nsmall black disc that can be inserted into devices throughout\nthe valley. People often decorate and personalize their discs to\ndistinguish them from one another.\nNetwork Tethers\nWhen wandering cities and travelers want to access the\nNetwork in the Wastes, they throw large hooks known\nas tethers over the wires above, allowing them to charge\ntechnology and collect data from any location. Some\ntechnomancers can even intercept Network messages using\ntethers, though this requires specialized knowledge and\nequipment.\nSometimes more ambitious or desperate individuals, known\nas skimmers, climb up to the lines and use smaller hooks or\ncontraptions to slide along the Network cables, allowing them\nto gather data and traverse the Wastes from above.\nWandering Cities\nThe wandering cities are a true testament to the ingenuity\nof the people in the Echo Vale. Most cities precariously\nbalance atop a remnant or a specially crafted vehicle piloted\nby a single driver or team. These vehicles come in all shapes\nand sizes and very often have collections of smaller crafts\nthat travel with them for hunting, defense, or the general\nexpansion of their populace.\nCARROWCROFT WALKAWAY\nThis behemoth is one of the largest of its kind, with layers\nof buildings crowded atop a walking machine and guns\njutting out at all angles from its turtle-like form. Recently,\nCarrowcroft leaders became dissatisfied with sending\nout small Croft Walkers to pick on less protected towns\nand travelers, leading them to try something much more\nambitious.\nFor decades, the leaders of Carrowcroft have had their sights\nset on the abundance of technology and scrap behind the\nwalls of Argent. They’ve recently made a number of attacks\nagainst the formidable city. The Argent guard has held them\noff for the time being, but not without considerable loss of life\non both sides.\nNow, with Argent thrown into violence by the Remnant’s Fury,\npoliticians in the walled city worry that the Croft Walkers will\ncome back to attack while they’re vulnerable. There’s even\na rumor circulating that Carrowcroft Walkaway somehow\ninfiltrated the Motherboard and initiated the virus, allowing\nthem to harvest scrap from the other settlements in the valley\none by one. As they use only operator-driven mechanicals,\nthey have a considerable advantage until someone can access\nthe Motherboard to understand the cause.\nThere’s also a rumor in the Wastes that, though Carrowcroft\ndoesn’t use remnants for labor, they are harvesting their cores\nto use in unique ways no other technomancers have been able\nto before.\nMOTHERBOARD\n298 \tChapter 5: Motherboard\n\n-- 299 of 415 --\n\nMOTHERBOARD\nOTHER WANDERING CITIES\nYou can populate the Echo Vale with the wandering cities below\nor create your own.\nThe May Trader Caravan: A collection of smaller vehicles,\nthis ragtag group travels the Wastes together hunting wild\nremnants for scrap and trading with anyone with quantum\nor a rare piece of technology from the fallen world. May\nTraders are considered especially brave, as they don’t use\nwalls or a tall walker to keep them safe from remnants.\nTheir caravan is a collection of mechanicals\tmechanicals that sit low to\nthe ground, and they sacrifice strong defenses for speed\nand maneuverability.\nThe Library: Built atop a large, spider-like remnant,\nthe Library is a prime example of the insular nature of\nmany valley cities, wandering or walled. Those who live\nhere aren’t interested in adapting and developing new\ntechnologies as much as protecting items and information\nfrom the fallen world.\nNereidus: A long, centipede-like ship with hundreds of oars\nthat snakes through the water off the coast of the Echo\nVale. Those who live here share a very communal way of\nlife. Instead of having one leader, they elect a new Mouth of\nthe People each season.\nWalled Cities\nMost stationary cities in the Echo Vale were built into ancient\nruins, with new walls constructed around their borders to\nprotect citizens from remnants and raiders. Some cities\nalso use geographical formations and ancient structures\nfor defense, while others are rapidly developing innovative\ndefense systems.\nARGENT\nArgent has long been the target of attention across the valley.\nWith the most well-preserved ancient skyscrapers, the best\nfortifications, and the largest collection of tame remnants in\nthe Echo Vale, this heavily stratified city is also a bastion of\nwealth. Their strictly regimented guard protects the streets\nand borders, and their prison labor system keeps government\nscrap operations working twenty-four hours a day.\nIn the wake of the Remnant’s Fury, the leader of Argent,\nknown as the Priv, sent messengers to all walled cities within\nthe valley to try to unify and uncover a solution. There’s talk\nthat they will organize and attempt to enter the tower of the\nMotherboard, but this would violate many of the most devout\norders of the Vale.\nOTHER WALLED CITIES\nYou can populate the Echo Vale with the walled cities below or\ncreate your own.\nCalcarus: This city consists of a single ancient skyscraper,\nnow filled with its own small forest. Its citizens have\ngrafted numerous wooden buildings onto the tower’s\nexterior, using Calcarus’s height to keep themselves safe\nfrom remnants.\nThe Northern Oracle: The site of many pilgrimages, this\nsmall village hosts a massive amphitheater filled with\nscreens. The High Oracle claims she can use the screens\nto speak to the Motherboard, but only her most devout\nfollowers have ever claimed to see it.\nSwitch Withawick: This city is entirely underground, and\nits citizens’ eyes are sensitive to light because the people\nrarely come up to the surface. There are two prominent\nrumors about the Switch: that its citizens are cannibals\n(unlikely), and that they know how to create new remnant\nconsciousnesses (possible).\nDesigning a City\nWhen you design your own wandering or walled city, you can\nstart with the following questions:\n• Does this city wander? If so, what is it built on? If not,\nwhat do its walls or fortifications look like?\n• What does this place look like? What architectural\nelements are from the fallen world? What portions are\nnew?\n• In what unique ways have the people used fallen world\nscraps and technologies?\n• How do the citizens feel about remnants? The\nMotherboard?\n• What cultural custom is unique to this city?\n• What do these people want that they don’t have? What do\nthey have to offer others in trade?\n299\tChapter 5: Motherboard\n\n-- 300 of 415 --\n\nTHE INCITING INCIDENT\nYou can use the prompt below to start your campaign, or\ncreate your own.\nAfter the outbreak of the Remnant’s Fury, Argent’s city guard\nscrambled to subdue the violent machines. But wave after\nwave succumbed to the malicious virus, and politicians grew\nmore desperate to avoid widespread fear.\nPriv Maelor Rhodek (orderborne elf, she/her), the city’s\ncharismatic leader, sent a messenger to assemble a team\nthat has the skill and experience to handle remnants, go\nundercover as civilians in the machinists’ Build Sector, and\nfigure out what’s causing the remnant attacks.\nPriv Rhodek gives her word that any scrap the party acquires\nwhile protecting the city is theirs to keep. In return, she asks\nthat they collect as many remnant cores as possible so she\ncan pass them to her technomancers to diagnose the cause of\nthe violence. She also gives the party the name of a surprising\ncontact to see before they head into the scrap factory where\nmany attacks have occurred.\nThe contact is Mac the Scrap Jack (wanderborne faun,\nhe/him), who runs an illegal scrap operation, making him an\nunlikely friend for the very person that outlaws his work. But\non the Priv’s word, he gives the party a Hotspot. This illegal\ndevice can be carried as a backpack and, when set down and\nactivated, it stalls out nearby remnants for a few moments,\nallowing the party to get out of a bind.\nHe also gives the party an offer: save one of the remnant cores\nthey recover and bring it to him instead of Rhodek. He’ll pay\nthem a few quantum, and they’ll have the opportunity to look\nat the data from the core to try and see what’s “causing all this\nruckus with the rems.”\nAs they fight their way through the factory, does the party\nhave compassion for the once-tame remnants, or do they\ndispose of them indiscriminately? Will the players try to talk\nto the factory workers to learn more about the Remnant’s\nFury, or will they operate like a cleanup crew, keep their eye\non the scrap they stand to gain? Will they bring the Priv all the\nremnant cores they collect, or will they save one for Mac and\nrisk trouble from the city guard? If they perform well, will Priv\nRhodek tell the party more about the Remnant’s Fury and the\ninvolvement of the Motherboard?\nFOR THE GM\nAs the party defeats violent remnants within the factory,\nprovide each PC one remnant core alongside the scrap\nthey would normally obtain from their battles (see the\nupcoming “Crafting & Trading” section). The following item\ndescription explains the Hotspot’s mechanics and lists the\nscrap requirements to craft a new one.\nHotspot: (Consumable) Activate to make all remnants\nwithin Very Close range Restrained.\nScrap: 5 triggers, 8 wires, 9 copper, 6 fuses, 3 relays, 1 battery\nMOTHERBOARD\n300 \tChapter 5: Motherboard\n\n-- 301 of 415 --\n\nCAMPAIGN MECHANICS\nThe following mechanics are unique to this campaign.\nTech Damage\nIn a Motherboard campaign, magic damage is instead called\ntech damage. This damage is caused by technomancy; it\nmight be a piercing shrill, a concussive blast, a blinding flash,\nswarming nanobots, a drone emitting a high-powered plasma\nbeam, or anything other product of supremely advanced\ntechnology.\nIkonis & Other Tools\nThe following sections detail how weapons, armor, and other\ntechnology are used in a Motherboard campaign.\nIKONIS\nCharacters don’t have access to Daggerheart’s normal\nselection of primary and secondary weapons during this\ncampaign.\nInstead, characters receive a personalized weapon known\nas an Ikonis, a special weapon given to citizens of the Echo\nVale when they come of age. It starts as a simple rod of metal\nand is designed to receive modifications as the bearer ages,\nshaped according to their needs. It can evolve to become\nmany types of weapons—a staff with webs of colorful wire\nwrapped around its hilt, an ornate bow humming with energy,\na heavy hammer designed for the forge, a spear with knobs\nand triggers that allow for different attachments, or anything\nelse that might suit the wielder.\nPlayers will design their character’s Ikonis using the\nMotherboard module sheet (available in the appendix or at\nwww.daggerheart.com/downloads). Each player should take\na copy of the module and slide it under the right side of their\ncharacter sheet. Then, they will make selections about trait,\nrange, and damage in the top section of the module, then\nmake up a name and description for their weapon. Finally,\nthey’ll record the weapon’s details in the Primary Weapon slot\nof their character sheet.\nIkonis are always considered to be two-handed weapons and\nstart with the “Bonded” feature:\nBonded: Gain a bonus to your damage rolls equal to your\nlevel.\nAUGMENTS\nIkonis also allow PCs to install augments. A character’s Ikonis\nstarts with two Augment slots at Tier 1, showing that it has\nevolved from its most basic form, and it gains an additional\nslot at each subsequent tier. Augments can be crafted as a\ndowntime move when PCs have the scrap to do so. (See the\nupcoming “Crafting & Trading” section for more information.)\nAn Ikonis starts with no augments installed. A character may\nbuild as many augments as they’d like, but they can only install\na number equal to the Augment slots they have available.\nFor example, even if a level 1 PC has three augments built,\nthey can only install two on their Ikonis at a time. When they\nprogress to level 2 (and they become a Tier 2 PC), they can\nhave all three augments installed. While installed, augments\nare treated as additional features for that weapon. PCs\nmay freely swap augments they’ve already crafted during\ndowntime.\nThe Motherboard character sheet module includes a selection\nof base augments for PCs to choose from, but GMs are\nencouraged to make more to offer their players as well, using\nthe provided options as a template.\nARMOR\nCharacters have access to Daggerheart’s normal selection\nof armor, but should flavor it to their preference within the\ncampaign setting.\nNETWORK TETHER\nEach PC adds a Network tether to their inventory at character\ncreation. Tethers are typically large hooks attached to a\ndata cable. These allow travelers to toss the hook onto an\noverhead wire to charge their technology and gain access to\nthe Network while moving through the Wastes. PCs must have\naccess to the Network, via a tether or other means, to perform\ndowntime moves.\nMOTHERBOARD\n301\tChapter 5: Motherboard\n\n-- 302 of 415 --\n\nCrafting & Trading\nIn this campaign frame, gold is not used as a currency.\nInstead, PCs can gather scrap to trade for a currency known\nas quantum. The Motherboard character sheet module helps\nto track their current scrap, along with how much quantum\nthey have to spend. All PCs start with 5 quantum.\nThe Quantum Economy\nUse the following conversion for Daggerheart when pricing\nother goods and services using quantum.\n10 quantum = 1 handful of gold\n100 quantum = 1 bag of gold\n1000 quantum = 1 chest of gold\nGathering Scrap\nWhen the PCs defeat remnant adversaries, they can collect\nscrap after the combat. There are three categories of scrap,\neach with an associated die size: Shards (d6), Metals (d8),\nand Components (d10). When the PCs are collecting scrap,\ndetermine which categories of scrap and how many of each\n(which determines the number of dice they roll) they can find.\nEach player individually rolls the dice you determine, and\nthe result of each die is compared to the associated scrap\ncategory table, listed here and on the Motherboard character\nsheet module, to determine what scrap a character receives.\nIf a rolled result falls between two values, select the lower\nnumbered option. A character receives one piece of scrap per\ndie, which is recorded on the line next to that kind of scrap on\nthe character sheet module.\nTip: Think of the numbers on the roll table as thresholds;\nwhen you reach that threshold, you get that scrap.\nSCRAP CATEGORY TABLES\nShards (d6)\n1 \t2 \t3 \t4 \t5 \t6\nGear \tCoil \tWire \tTrigger \tLens \tCrystal\nMetals (d8)\n1 \t3 \t5 \t6 \t7 \t8\nAluminum \tCopper \tCobalt \tSilver \tPlatinum \tGold\nComponents (d10)\n1 \t3 \t6 \t8 \t9 \t10\nFuse \tCircuit \tDisc \tRelay \tCapacitor \tBattery\nExample: After a standard fight with some remnants, the\nGM tells the players to each roll two dice for Shards, two\ndice for Metals, and a die for Components. The first player\nrolls a 2 and a 4 for Shards, gaining a coil and a trigger.\nThey roll a 5 and a 7 for Metals and gain a cobalt and a\nplatinum. Finally, they roll a 9 for components and gain a\ncapacitor. The second player rolls a 1 and a 6 for Shards,\n3 and 6 for Metals, and a 5 for Components. They gain a\ngear, crystal, copper, silver, and circuit.\nMOTHERBOARD\n302 \tChapter 5: Motherboard\n\n-- 303 of 415 --\n\nScrap Reward Table\nUse the following table as general guidance for scrap rewards after encounters:\nScrap\nRewards\nEasy\nFight\nStandard\nFight\nDifficult\nFight\nVery Difficult\nFight\nA few remnants \t2 Shards \t2 Shards, 1 Metal 2 Shards, 1 Metal,\n1 Component\n2 Shard, 2 Metals,\n1 Component\nMostly remnants \t2 Shards, 1 Metal 2 Shards, 2 Metals,\n1 Component\n3 Shard, 2 Metals,\n1 Component\n3 Shard, 3 Metals,\n2 Components\nAll remnants 2 Shards, 1 Metal,\n1 Component\n3 Shards, 2 Metals,\n2 Components\n3 Shards, 3 Metals,\n2 Components\n4 Shards, 3 Metals,\n3 Component\nRELICS\nThere is an additional category of scrap called Relics. These are unique pieces of scrap only found on specific remnant\nadversaries. When PCs defeat a particularly important or powerful remnant adversary, you might grant them each a Relic along\nwith scrap from the table above. These relics should be customized based on the adversary, such as steelhorn of the stag, lens\nof the flickering falcon, jaw piston of the cryodrake, or gold scales of the scrappersnap. Relics are worth 20 quantum and are\noften used to craft powerful augments.\nYou should also provide opportunities for PCs to seek specific Shard, Metal, or Component rewards, whether that be through\nNPC contracts, hunting down particular adversaries, exploring certain areas, or through scrap shacks.\nTip: The values on the Scrap Reward Table above are designed for a campaign of around 50 sessions, with 1-2 fights per session.\nIf you plan to do a shorter or longer campaign, adjust your rewards accordingly.\nCrafting with Scrap\nThe characters can use their collected scrap to craft augments\nfor their Ikonis and other items. When they have enough scrap\nto build an augment, they can use a downtime move and\nspend the appropriate amount of scrap. When an augment\ncalls for a generic Relic, a PC can spend any Relic they have.\nSome augments have prerequisites called precompiles. When\nthis precompile is met, the augment is available to be crafted.\nThe base augments have precompiles that require a PC to be\nin a certain tier, but a precompile can be anything: a certain\nvalue for the PC’s Strength or Evasion, a specific domain or\nclass, or anything else you’d like. Augments can always be\nbroken back into their scrap for parts as needed.\nYou’re also encouraged to give PCs additional tasks or\nchallenges that utilize scrap, such as building a specific\nmachine for a task or collecting scrap for an ally who’s trying\nto repair a remnant.\nSelling Scrap for Quantum\nLocal scrap shacks in each city generally trade scrap for\nquantum and quantum for scrap. By default, each piece of\nscrap is worth its value on the previous roll table (whether\nplayers are buying or selling), and each shop has a daily stock\nequal to 1d10 of each Shard, 1d8 of each Metal, and 1d6 of\neach Component. When PCs want to buy a certain type of\nscrap, roll to determine how many are in stock. These values\ncan always change at your discretion.\nExample: A PC wants to sell Components at a local scrap\nshack: 2 circuits and 1 battery. Because circuits are worth\n3 quantum each and batteries are worth 10, they would\nget 6 quantum for the circuits and 10 quantum for the\nbattery, for a total of 16 quantum. They also want to sell\nsome Shards: 2 lenses and 6 springs. Each lens is worth\n5 quantum and each spring is worth 2, earning them an\nadditional 22 quantum. They now have 38 quantum.\nThey need to buy 1 crystal and 4 silver to craft an augment.\nThe GM says the scrap shack has enough in stock, so they\npay 6 for the crystal and 12 for the silver for a total of 18\nquantum. They leave the shack with 20 quantum, 1 crystal,\nand 4 silver.\nMOTHERBOARD\n303\tChapter 5: Motherboard\n\n-- 304 of 415 --\n\nWRITING IN KOHD\nLanguage designed by Chris Willett\nKohd, the language of the fallen world’s technology, has long been a mystery to the people of the Echo Vale. If you’d like to\ngive your players the opportunity to learn how to decipher and write in it over the course of a campaign, you’re encouraged\nto use this language. We recommend delivering them messages early on from the Motherboard that they can’t read, having\ntechnomancers reveal pieces of the language to them as they progress through the story, and then finally giving them the tools\nto read and write the full language by the climax.\nSUBROUTINE 1.\nNODAL WORD GLYPH CONSTRUCTION\nExample Word - MOTHERBOARD\nAn individual language unit (word) has no discrete letters.\nKohd is based on nine nodes, each representing 3 letters\n(other than the YZ node).\nEach word is a circuit that flows from Charge\nto\nGround.\nMOTHERBOARD\nConstruction Step 1\nTo begin making the word Motherboard, draw a single node\n(the circle) and connect the charge indicator (the line). This is\ncalled the charge node and indicates where the word begins.\nTake note of the position of the charge node for the word you\nare writing relative to the other nodes. Both M and O are in\nthe center node.\nConstruction Step 2\nLocate the second node for the next letter in the word. In this\ncase, T is down and left. Add a trace line to connect the circuit\nbetween the charge node and the new node. Every trace line\nruns from a source node to an end node.\nPeriod\nPUNCTUATION\nConnects to final Ground\n(other than comma)\nThis is placed in an unused corner of a\ndiagram if the position of letters is vague.\nARTICLES\nLive in starting node for their word\nComma (Circuit continues)\nExclamation Point\nQuestion Mark\nThe (definite article)\nA (indefinite article)\nUnique/there exists\nexactly one\nThere is/there exists\nIf\nIf/then\nSo/thus/causing\nBecause/since\nAnd\nOr\nTrue/is\nFalse/not\nGround (word end)\nNull\n(*The example above is not needed.)\nCharge (word start)\nABC\nJKL\nSTU\nDEF\nMNO\nVWX\nGHI\nPQR\nYZ\n304 \tChapter 5: Motherboard\n\n-- 305 of 415 --\n\nConstruction Step 3\nThe source node has the letter M in its first position, N in its\nsecond, and O in its third. For M, add one subnode (the dot)\nto the trace line, and for O, add three subnodes.\nsubnodes for O\nsubnode for M\nT is in the second position on its node, so as we connect the\ntrace line to the node containing H, we add two subnodes.\nM, O\nT\nH\nContinuing, we can get all the way to MOTHERB. At that\npoint, if we were to connect the trace to the MNO node,\nthe order of letters would become vague. To keep this from\nhappening, draw a ring around or within the MNO node and\nconnect the trace line to that ring.\nContinue on, adding trace lines, subnodes, and node rings as\nneeded until you reach the last letter of the word.\nConstruction Step 4\nLastly, add the ground indicator to place the last subnode and\nterminate the trace.\nConstruction Step 5\nConstructed words sometimes include too few nodes, so\ntheir orientation on the nine-node grid is vague. For example,\nwords like felled, mount, and homing require just two diagonal\nnodes. In these cases, we add a null modifier to a remote\ncorner of the glyph to indicate the relative position of the\nnodes involved in the word.\nMOTHERBOARD\nfelled\tfelled\nMount\tMount\nHoming\tHoming\n305\tChapter 5: Motherboard\n\n-- 306 of 415 --\n\nSUBROUTINE 2. SENTENCE CONSTRUCTION\nOur example for this subroutine will be this sentence: The network carries communication from city to city.\nA few of these words in kohd have simplified, non-nodally constructed forms, such as “the” and “from/to.”\nRefer to the following lexicon for a full breakdown of these words:\nConstruction Step 1\nFirst, we signify the beginning of a sentence with a coupler, a\ncomplex series of solder points where the kohders could fuse\none sentence circuit to another. An example of a coupler can\nbe seen here; there is no significance to the various lengths in\nits bars.\nConstruction Step 3\nApply articles. In this case, only Network needs to be modified\nwith an article, which slots into the charge node.\nConstruction Step 2\nNext, lay out all nodally constructed words in a line in order.\nIgnore any words with a shortened version in the lexicon.\nConstruction Step 4\nAdd words from the lexicon. Note here that from-to replaces\ntwo words, not just one. Like if-then, it goes between two\nglyphs, changing it from “from city to city” to “city from-to\ncity.” Small words from the lexicon can go anywhere they fit.\nMOTHERBOARD\nJKL\nMNO\nPQR\nSTU \tVWX \tYZ\nAnd\nOr\nThere is.\nThere exists.\nFrom-to.

That is, until\na massive colossus answered the call of something ancient\nand apocalyptic, rising from the earth and devastating the\nlands. The bold prospectors, tired laborers, and born-again\nworshippers in the dusty town of Wyllin’s Gulch were thrown\nfrom their routine of industry and exploitation, forced to\nraise scattered armies and watch them die to the behemoth’s\nstrength. And this is only the first of many titanic beasts\npoised to terrorize the land. In a Colossus of the Drylands\ncampaign, you’ll play a heroic posse of mavericks who must\nsave their home from a legion of colossi and a primordial god\nseeking vengeance.\nTONE & FEEL\nAwe-Inspiring, Dusty, Eerie, Gritty, Larger than Life,\nTerrifying\nTHEMES\nBreaking Cycles, The Burden of Heroism, Faith vs. Doubt,\nGreed, Ordinary People Accomplishing the Extraordinary\nTOUCHSTONES\nShadow of the Colossus, Red Dead Redemption, Deadlands,\nOn the Shoulders of Colossus\n308 \tChapter 5: Colossus of the Drylands\n\n-- 309 of 415 --\n\nOVERVIEW\nIf your group decides to play this campaign, give your players the following information before character creation.\nThe Prophecy of the Drylands God begins as thus: In the\ncenter of the world there is a mountain, and deep beneath that\nmountain there is an ancient and terrible god—a Forgotten\nGod—struggling to break free of his confinement. One day\nKudamat, the First Doom will escape his earthen tomb with\nthe help of his nine colossi, the Children of Godfell, to sunder\nthe world, his hated prison, and tear down the sky like fabric.\nAs the New Gods fall from the Hallows Above, Kudamat will\nslay them with his stone sickle that their blood will flood the\nMortal Realm. In this sanguine tide, Kudamat and the new\ngeneration of colossi, each made from the god’s very being,\nwill destroy the creatures of the Mortal Realm and make room\nfor abhorrent creations to repopulate the land, sea, and sky.\nIn his triumph, Kudamat will free the many trapped gods of his\ngeneration and become the high lord among all divinities.\nAt least, that’s how the old story went. Most people believed it\nwas just another tall tale of the Drylands.\nThe History of the Gods is a myth known by many and\nbelieved by few: When the Forgotten Gods built the Mortal\nRealm in the Earliest Age, they made a place of joys and\nsorrows, freedom and labor. All the creatures of the land,\nsea, and sky worked for the many gods and enjoyed the spoils\nand trials of deities that had nothing but time and endless\ncuriosity. These immortals could not fathom that the New\nGods would one day rise and overthrow them in a violent\nbattle, tossing them from their place in the high Hallows\nAbove and entrapping them in the Mortal Realm and the\nCircles Below.\nMany Forgotten Gods imprisoned in the Mortal Realm were\ntrapped within the ground, buried over the centuries beneath\nthe rise and fall of civilizations. The deific essence of these\ngods bleeds from their lasting wounds—and whether this\nenervation was intentional or not, their power seeped into the\nearth where they’re entombed, running like veins of stone up\nto the surface. The crystal born from these veins is known as\n“essentia,” and all magic in the Mortal Realm comes from its\npower. As such, there’s a mad scramble for any opportunity\nto harvest this precious resource, and in the eyes of those in\npower, land with a vein of essentia is worth the millions of\nlives sacrificed to the mines built to dig the crystals up.\nGodfell Mountain is one such land. Sitting in the middle of\na crowd of high mesas, amid arid countryside peppered by\nmeager lakes and sparse forests, this peak marks the richest\nessentia mines on the continent. Though it’s not the center of\nthe world as the stories say, it’s the hub of a region filled with\nnewfound wealth, industry, and an ever-expanding network of\ndusty towns run by crooked sheriffs.\nThe numerous veins of essentia running from Godfell\nMountain come from the power of Kudamat, the First Doom,\na Forgotten God seeking freedom and the destruction of the\nentire Mortal Realm. As these makeshift towns follow the\nveins of crystal ever closer to Godfell, they move toward the\nblighted earth the New Gods left to keep mortals from the\nprison of the ancient god. This mountain is a desolate and\ndangerous place where few can survive, but that doesn’t stop\npowerful mining operations and bold prospectors from trying\ntheir luck.\nKudamat was trapped within Godfell Mountain, or rather, the\nmountain was formed around him when the Forgotten Gods\nlost to the New Gods at the end of the Earliest Age. Ever since,\nlike many of his kind, Kudamat was forced to wait for the day\nhe could finally break free. But it wasn’t a simple burial the\nNew Gods performed. To trap the First Doom, the usurper\ngods split part of his being into nine pieces and tasked nine\nmortals with hiding the soul shards so Kudamat could not\nreach his full power.\nBut they should not have given such a paramount task to\nmere mortals. The nine riders took the shards as far from the\nmountain as they could manage and buried them in the arid\nearth, but it wasn’t far enough. Over the centuries, Kudamat\nreached out through the dirt and stone, veins of crystalline\nessentia stretching out like tendrils to find his missing pieces.\nOver time, the godly strife of the Earliest Age and the hidden\nresting places of the soul shards drifted out of memory and\ninto stories and legends. Legends most sensible folk ignored\nor forgot.\nWhen Kudamat found the first piece of his soul, he began\nchanneling its power to restore his godhood, and a single\nthundering quake tore a fissure through the center street\nof Wyllin’s Gulch—a terrible earthquake, they believed, not\nunderstanding the apocalyptic toll ringing out across the\nsands. Kudamat then used a fragment of his divine might to\ncraft a colossus and droves of accompanying aberrations that\nwould guard the soul shard while he siphons the remainder\nof his power and seeks out the other eight shards. Even with\nonly the barest portion of his power restored, Kudamat’s\nreawakening is all but inevitable. He grows stronger by the\nday, searching out the remaining pieces and building more\ncolossi to guard them. If left unchecked, he will reclaim the\npower of all nine shards and break his earthen shackles, rising\nagain to bring doom to this world.\nPreacher Rayos (he/him) was the first, or perhaps only the\nloudest, to recognize the rise of the colossus outside Wyllin’s\nGulch as the first step in the Prophecy of the Drylands God.\nHe proclaimed the story of Kudamat, warning people of the\nincreased dangers of the god’s charged essentia. Above all\nelse, he stressed the importance of finding the soul shards\nand keeping the god from siphoning them. To get the word\nout, he took his flock from their home in the Left Luck Outpost\nto Wyllin’s Gulch, the unofficial capital of the western line,\nwhere he continues to preach, growing more popular with\neach passing day. He already had enough of a following in\nhis community—and now times are apocalyptic enough that\npeople are eager for a spiritual leader.\nCOLOSSUS OF THE DRYLANDS\n309\tChapter 5: Colossus of the Drylands\n\n-- 310 of 415 --\n\nWyllin’s Gulch worships no gods but the earning and spending\nof gold, and it will take more than a violent colossus to get the\npeople of this town to pay attention to an ancient prophecy.\nIn the early days of the Essentia Rush, roughly 40 years ago,\nthe Gulch was established as the first western outpost in the\nregion surrounding Godfell Mountain, just a few miles from a\nrich vein of essentia. As more and more of the crystals were\nunearthed, powerful moguls established processing plants\nto speed up the time between mine and money. Belching\nfactories were built up the sides of the Twin Turtles, two great\nmesas that bordered the burgeoning town, their massive\nconveyor lifts hauling tons of essentia to the manufactories\nthat process the crystals into the conductive batteries most\nfolk use to power their homes, weapons, and all manner of\nmagical items.\nToday, with its natural fortifications and wealthy elite, Wyllin’s\nGulch is the gatekeeper for anyone approaching Godfell\nMountain on the western train line. As such, the townspeople\neither work mining and processing essentia or host money\ntraps that appeal to new fools who come to try their hand at\nprospecting the crystals.\nA wide variety of folks inhabit Wyllin’s Gulch. The arid plains,\nbreathtaking skies, and the possibility of boundless riches\nattract all types. Living away from the prying eye of larger\nlaw enforcement is another perk—while there are sheriffs\nin Wyllin’s Gulch, they’re paid to protect the mines and\nmanufacturing rather than uphold any version of “justice.” It’s\ncommon for outlaw gangs to seek their fortunes by stealing\nthe valuable crystals, while others, who see these mining\noperations as anathema, destroy the equipment that tears\nessentia from the ground. But most outlaws find greater\nsuccess at the smaller essentia outposts than this bastion of\ndusty fortitude.\nEssentia outposts range in size from a small collection of\ntents to a thriving town. Some outposts are formed when just\na few folks get together to mine the same vein or sift the same\nriver. Others are created when a company purchases a parcel\nof land containing a vein and installs a small settlement of\nworkers. Still others are larger towns built by people wanting\na bit of community along with their work. Though essentia\noutposts can vary in size, style, and operating procedure, one\nthing is always true: where there is an outpost around Godfell\nMountain, there’s a vein of essentia. Now, these outposts face\nthe coming threat of more colossi rising from the earth as\nKudamat locates his soul shards and uses the essentia veins to\nsiphon back his power.\nCOMMUNITIES\nAll communities are available, but some have unique aspects\nwithin a Colossus of the Drylands campaign. As needed, provide\nthe following information to your players and choose one or\nmore of the questions to ask them during your session zero.\nLoreborne\nIn the Drylands, many folks hold fervent beliefs about the\nForgotten Gods, the New Gods, and the essentia crystals\nthat power the world. Loreborne communities take a more\nscholarly, possibly even evangelical, approach to these beliefs.\nSome follow the “forgotten ways” and utilize raw essentia in\ntheir spiritual practice, while others abstain from essentia\nentirely, believing it’s a profanity to the New Gods they\nworship.\n• What were you taught about the origins of the Mortal\nRealm, and how did the colossi emerging affect that\nworldview?\n• Kudamat’s impending return changed the beliefs of many,\nbut not you. What did you experience in the past that\nmakes your faith unshakeable?\n• You refuse to use the magic of essentia because you follow\nthe “new ways.” How has your devotion to the New Gods\nhelped you? How has it hindered you?\nOrderborne\nSome orderborne characters come from the law. Whether\nsheriff or deputy, these individuals are often seen as the most\npowerful members of their town. Though these officers are\nusually in the pocket of rich essentia mine moguls, if not fully\non the payroll, they’re often the most prepared to protect\ncivilians in times of danger. Other orderborne communities\nare organized bands of outlaws—some who steal and\nsabotage essentia outposts with a moral goal in mind, and\nothers who just need crystals to sell or power their own magic.\nEither way, they always operate by a code, unique as it may\nbe.\n• What incident during your time working for the sheriff\nprepared you to help panicking civilians worried about the\ncolossus?\n• You and your posse have killed to get what you need. What\nrules do you have about who you’ll never harm?\n• You once took a bribe to do something you regret. What\nhappened, and what was your reward?\nCOLOSSUS OF THE DRYLANDS\n310 \tChapter 5: Colossus of the Drylands\n\n-- 311 of 415 --\n\nHighborne\nIn the Drylands, most true highborne folk come from\nelsewhere, seeking to further enrich themselves using the\nindustries surrounding essentia. Some were born into wealth,\nwhile others are fallen business owners forced to move out\nto the desert for their “next big venture.” Regardless of how\nhighborne characters originally found fortune, they often find\nthemselves at odds with the beating sun and the clinging dust,\nthough they have employees to do any task that could even\nvaguely be classified as “work.” The grand myth that keeps\npeople prospecting is that anyone can find an essentia vein or\nriver deposit and change their lives with riches untold. Though\nsome have done it, they’re few and far between. Most earn\nenough to keep on working for another day, and a few live\ncomfortably with a little to spare.\n• What disaster befell your family’s fortune that precipitated\nyour move to the Drylands?\n• What local custom or practice do you find refreshing that\npeople from home would balk at?\n• How has your lineage, title, or other highborne affectations\ngotten you in trouble in the Drylands?\nRidgeborne and Underborne\nIn this region of mountains, mines, high deserts, and sparse\ngreenery, both ridgeborne and underborne communities\nthrive. Ridgeborne characters could come from small\noutposts, family encampments, or other groups that make\nhome atop the dangerous crags of the region. Some of these\ncommunities may even be bold enough to live where others\nwill not—on Godfell Mountain. Though it is dangerous,\ndesolate, and blighted, the mountain yields the richest\nessentia for those willing to risk everything.\nAn underborne character could be part of a community that\ntook to old essentia mines for refuge, building homes in the\ndarkness beneath the earth. Others are essentia miners who\ncreate small underborne communities with fellow members\nof their profession who spend most of their life excavating the\ncrystals from the stone. This is one of the most dangerous\nyet common jobs in the region, and it makes for a hardy lot.\nWhether a character grew up in a Drylands outpost or moved\nto one to prospect, there are more than enough communities\npeppered throughout the Drylands that any of these places\ncould be called home.\n• You were born in the mountains and mesas of the\nDrylands. What do you know about this land that new\nprospectors will never understand?\n• You are afraid of the dark, but venture into the mines every\nday anyway. What keeps you going back?\n• You once found something unexpected near Godfell\nMountain. What was it, and who did you tell about your\ndiscovery?\nSlyborne\nWith its untold veins of essentia bringing folks seeking to\nmake their fortune from the earth, the Drylands also appeal to\npeople seeking to make their fortune from the exploitation of\nothers. There’s no small share of bad actors who want to get\nrich and get out quick, either by selling useless parcels of land,\nshilling water-and-vinegar “snake oil,” or outright theft. But\nsome slyborne communities are more interested in stopping\nmajor operations from stripping essentia from the desert than\nrobbing the innocent. The “Harlan Family,” a small but active\nposse of thieves led by Trace Harlan (they/them), works out\nof Wyllin’s Gulch for one purpose: to stop ambitious tycoons\nfrom mining and producing essentia batteries. They hope to\none day tear the factories from the walls of the mesa and drive\nout the greedy moguls that put profit over people.\n• What darkness in your past did you attempt to leave\nbehind when coming to the Drylands?\n• You once betrayed a close accomplice. What happened\nand why haven’t you spoken since the incident?\n• You had to go through a terrifying initiation to join your\nposse. What did you do, and how has it changed you\nforever?\nWanderborne\nWanderborne characters are just as likely to originate from\nwithin the region as arrive from elsewhere. As most things\nin the Drylands do, their wanderings gravitate toward the\nessentia veins. Some wanderborne communities are as old as\nGodfell Mountain itself, and they have stores of essentia they\nvisit across the desert. Others are new groups of unprepared\nprospectors who are more likely to die by sun or snake than\nfind any ease in the Drylands.\n• What common practice of outpost living do you find\nutterly baffling or uncomfortable?\n• You have a small cache of emergency items hidden in the\ndesert. What did you hide?\n• You used to live in an outpost, but something terrible\nhappened that caused you to leave. What happened, and\nwhy will you never return?\nCOLOSSUS OF THE DRYLANDS\n311\tChapter 5: Colossus of the Drylands\n\n-- 312 of 415 --\n\nANCESTRIES\nAll ancestries are available, but some have unique aspects\nwithin a Colossus of the Drylands campaign. As needed, provide\nthe following information to your players.\nAll Ancestries\nMany folks of all ancestries profess to feel the presence of\nessentia in the ground—especially while Kudamat is using it\nto siphon back his power. No one can prove if this is true or\nnot, but many use these claims to get high-paying positions\nworking for mining operations.\nClanks\nClanks are powered by essentia. If a player creates a clank,\nthey should consider how their character regularly obtains this\nresource and what happens if they’re unable to get enough.\nInfernis\nPlayers who have chosen the Infernis ancestry should consider\nhow their character’s relationship with their heritage from the\ndemons of the Circles Below plays into the various faiths of\nthe Drylands.\nFungril, Galapa, and Ribbets\nFungril, galapa, and ribbets native to the Drylands are most\noften well adapted to the desert, but those who aren’t from\nthese deserts commonly live near the few lakes in the region\nor devise systems to travel with large amounts of water.\nCLASSES\nAll classes are available, but some have unique aspects within\na Colossus of the Drylands campaign. As needed, provide the\nfollowing information to your players.\nDruids\nDruids in the Drylands are more equipped than many to\nnavigate the inhospitable environment. They’re familiar with\nthe unique qualities of desert flora and fauna, and their spells\nand abilities reflect that.\nRangers\nMany rangers in the Drylands are “lone riders” who prefer only\nthe company of their mount and ride from outpost to outpost,\nnever stopping for long. They’re often defenders of the weak\nwho stand up against local law enforcement when deputies\npush people around.\nSeraphs\nMany seraphs have strong relationships with their faith, either\nworshiping the Forgotten Gods (such as Kudamat) or the\nNew Gods. This also affects their relationship with the use\nof essentia—the former utilize the crystals prolifically, while\nthe latter may have a fraught relationship with magic. When\nplaying a seraph, players should consider how their character\nfeels about magic, as well as the way their character engages\nwith their faith within the community. Many choose to\nbecome preachers, healers, and prophets of the land.\nSyndicate Rogue\nThese rogues often operate as deputies, mining operation\noverseers, or members of outlaw posses. Though any of these\ngroups might work publicly, it takes a master of charm and\nnegotiation, as well as clandestine activity, to accomplish the\norganization’s more covert goals.\nCOLOSSUS OF THE DRYLANDS\n312 \tChapter 5: Colossus of the Drylands\n\n-- 313 of 415 --\n\nPLAYER PRINCIPLES\nIf your group decides to play this campaign, give your players\nthe following information before character creation.\nEmbrace the Drylands\nWhen building your character, consider how their place in the\nDrylands impacts their aesthetics and approach to the world.\nFind reasons for them to love the land despite its harshness as\nthey work desperately to protect the region from the monsters\ntrying to tear it asunder.\nFace the Unstoppable\nIn this campaign, your character stands against creatures\ntaller than the largest buildings, whose destructive power\nis only matched by the most devastating natural disasters.\nDecide what makes your character particularly equipped to\ndestroy colossi and, more importantly, what’s personally at\nstake for them should they fail.\nNavigate Your Faith\nThe Drylands are a land of extremes: it’s extremely hot,\nextremely harsh, and extremely easy to die. Folks approach\nreligion the same way. Some people believe that the gods\nnever existed and the stories about the origins of essentia are\njust marketing and grandstanding. Others continue to worship\nthe Forgotten Gods, attributing a spiritual aspect to their use\nof essentia. Still others believe essentia is a profanity and\ncommit crimes to close up the mines in the name of the New\nGods. Consider the beliefs your character held before the rise\nof first colossus and how they might have changed since.\nRide Like the Wind\nJust about everyone born in the Drylands can ride a mount\nfrom the moment they can walk, and newcomers are\nexpected to learn quickly. Unless you choose a feature\nfor your character that provides an animal companion or\napplicable spell with benefits, their mount will not change their\nmechanics or give them an advantage in combat. They can,\nhowever, use their mount to pass between towns and portions\nof the desert with added ease and speed. The colossal\nchildren of a vengeful god are on the rise, and the party has no\ntime to waste.\nCompared to what other creatures people of the Drylands\nride, is your character’s mount unique? Select their mount\nfrom the list below, or make up your own.\nHorse \tDire Wolf \tGiant Turtle\nBuffalo \tRhinoceros \tGiant Toad\nDeer \tGiant Goat \tGiant Scorpion\nElk \tGiant Jackalope \tGiant Centipede\nBear \tGiant Rattlesnake \tShadow Beast\nMountain Lion \tGiant Lizard \tRobotic Mount\nGM PRINCIPLES\nKeep the following guidance in mind while you GM this campaign.\nContrast the Mundane and the Extraordinary\nBefore the first colossus appeared in Wyllin’s Gulch, things\nwere pretty ordinary. Folks came in on the one train, sought\ntheir fortunes mining or panning for essentia, spent their\nmeager earnings on liquor at the bar, kept their mount fed and\ntheir belly (mostly) full, and tried to stay out of the way if a\nposse rode through town. Now, with the colossus rampaging,\nthe mines are flush with power to the point of explosion, and\ncreatures are forming seemingly overnight. Unfortunately, the\nimpending arrival of the First Doom does nothing to dissuade\nthe impending arrival of debt collectors, and the essentia\nrefineries still hunger for fuel. The cataclysmic foes threatening\nthe Drylands become more apocalyptic when juxtaposed\nagainst mundane moments found only in these small towns.\nEmphasize Scope and Scale\nThe Drylands are a big place. The mesas are massive, the\nsky stretches as far as the eye can see, and something about\nthe darkness of the nights feels infinite. This is a place that\nmakes one feel small, even on a normal day. The sprawling\ngeography is a perpetual reminder of the true insignificance of\ncivilization’s footprint. Confrontations with the colossi should\nserve as a reminder: the adventurers are but ants to them,\nscaling their bodies and stinging them with tiny weapons.\nTheir destruction is calamitous—a single footstep could level\na town. Let both the colossi and the landscape feel immense.\nMake Colossi an Allegory for Personal Woe\nThe colossi are destructive beings formed from aspects of\nKudamat’s soul and the environment they inhabit—but they\ncan also serve as allegories for the PCs’ personal journeys.\nWhen you can, use these behemoths to address the themes\nof the campaign, informed by the PCs’ choices and their\nbackstories. In your session zero, make note of themes or\nstruggles the players want to highlight in their characters’\nbackstories… then make them gigantic.\nFor example, if one of the characters has a past with a corrupt\nsmall-town sheriff with too much influence and a finger in\neveryone’s business, you could utilize Zuudra, the Many Arms\nof Calamity (see the upcoming “The Children of Godfell”\nsection) as a metaphor to represent the sheriff’s destructive\noverreach and the inescapable grip he holds on the outpost.\nOffer Chances for Creative Solutions to\nColossal Problems\nSome players may be satisfied with simply climbing a colossus\nand jabbing sharp things into their weak points until they\ndie. Other players might come up with elaborate plans and\ntraps, or even attempt to tame a colossus. Lean into these\nopportunities for player creativity, giving them plenty of nails\nuntil they figure out what hammer they want to use when\ntackling these monstrous beasts. Each colossi should have a\nunique personality, physicality, and weakness that encourages\nthe players’ ingenuity.\nCOLOSSUS OF THE DRYLANDS\n313\tChapter 5: Colossus of the Drylands\n\n-- 314 of 415 --\n\nDISTINCTIONS\nUse this information to prepare your campaign. You can also share it with your players as needed.\nThe Children of Godfell\nEach of Kudamat’s nine soul shards are protected by a\ncolossus known as a Child of Godfell. These beings are\nphysical manifestations of the god’s will, hellbent on\nprotecting their soul shard as its power is siphoned back\nto the mountain. Formed by elements of the soul shard’s\nsurroundings, each is unique in personality, form, and\ncapabilities.\nYou’ll need nine colossi to populate the area around Godfell\nMountain and guard Kudamat’s soul shards. You can use any\nof the colossi from the list below as inspiration, or make your\nown. (See the “Colossal Adversaries” section on page 318 for\nmechanical guidance on building a colossus.)\nExample Children of Godfell\nAandira, the One Who Devours: Her form is a mix of\nhumanoid and spider, and she scurries across the Drylands\non bent-back limb with a dozen mouths of broken teeth.\nAikar, Shepherd of the Meek: This bipedal colossus has\ntwo arms affixed with bladed shields, allowing them to\ndeflect and deliver blows with ease. Aikar’s howl can stop\nliving creatures in their tracks.\nAphedos, the Creeping Darkness: Aphedos is formed from\nthousands of flies that operate independently. Impossible\nto climb, he must be brought down by alternate means.\nBalorma, the Blooming Hornwolf: This wolf bears elk\nhorns formed of flourishing plant life. When she steps, she\nplants roots that suck the life from all they touch.\nChakantis, He Who Knows the End: This crystalline\nbeetle’s wingbeats rain down deadly shards onto the\nground, and his abdomen can vibrate at high frequency,\nshattering even stone.\nDaktadae, the Cleaver: A massive steel rhinoceros formed\nfrom a steam train, a cleaver emerging from his head\ninstead of a horn. He seeks vengeance upon those who’ve\nharmed him in the past.\nEriphisia, the Radiant Light of Eternal Cleansing: A\ncrystalline statue whose dozens of eyes cast blinding light\nupon the world. They reflect the sun upon victims as a ray\nof white, hot death.\nGa’mor, the Shade of Quick Death: Ga’mor is formed from\nthe shadows of mountains, buildings, and people. When\nthis amalgam steps into new darkness, they can adjust\ntheir shape to match the bounds of the shadow.\nHeladra, Sower of Sorrows: This cloaked figure weeps\nwaterfalls from unseen eyes, flooding the land wherever\nshe travels.\nIkeri, Injuries Untold: This apelike creature has the face\nof a bird. They are made of stone and carry an enormous\nmesa upon their back.\nImpahk, They Who Know No Rest: This massive desert\ncyclone never stops moving and consumes all they touch.\nKelir, the Virulent Hate and Her Hundred, Hundred\nChildren: A crablike, mountainous beast whose children\nscurry in and around her, bringing food as tribute.\nMirmett, the Lover of the Hollow Hearts. This giant\nhumanoid cage places enemies inside themself to be killed\nor eaten by the creatures that live within them.\nMoraidus, the Keeper of Graves: This centipede is formed\nfrom grave dirt and tombstones. Their arms are made of\nskeletons that hang from their composite form, reaching\nand scrabbling for anything that comes near.\nNocte, the Invisible Tide: Imperceptible to the eye, Nocte\nswims through the ground like a fish through water and\nattacks from below, pulling his victims into an early grave.\nOosha, Eerrae, and Yyisu, Three Who Parse Infinity:\nThese three humanoid figures can fight separately or come\ntogether as one terrifying form. They cut their victims into\npieces with rusted blades.\nPoy, Sky Skimmer of the Dust Sea: This massive shoebill\nstork is formed from the dust of the Drylands and traps\nenemies in their cavernous beak.\nQuelle, the Innocent Pain: A feline creature covered in\nthousands of burrowing tendrils, Quelle is fascinated by\nliving beings and tears their enemies apart to look inside.\nSyan’til, the Serpent of the Last Light: A serpent of\nlightning, Syan’til races down from the sky to strike with\nblazing speed.\nTakkan, the Bone Bearer: Built from hundreds of bones\nfrom deep within the earth, Takkan’s form is ever-shifting\nand ever-grinding as she moves.\nUsandi, the Bear of Five Faces: Able to see in all directions,\nUsandi has a ring of snapping teeth around his neck,\nsharpened spine bones jutting out of his back, and\nthrashing claws running up his limbs.\nVian and Naiv, the Makers of Undoing: These vespertilian\nbeasts corrode what they touch until it falls to dust. They\ncan only be killed by simultaneously striking weak points on\nboth creatures.\nXehamras, the Last Breath: Xehamras suffocates his\nvictims, consuming their dying breath to increase his\npower, all while barking raspy laughter from his coyote\nhead.\nZuudra, the Many Arms of Calamity: This cephalopod has\neight writhing limbs that rapidly shift between hardened\nstone spikes and rivers of flowing magma.\nCOLOSSUS OF THE DRYLANDS\n314 \tChapter 5: Colossus of the Drylands\n\n-- 315 of 415 --\n\nDesigning Your Own Colossus\nWhen you create colossi, ask yourself the following questions:\n• What do they look like? Are they similar to an animal, do\nthey resemble a particular player ancestry, or are they\nbuilt from pieces of the physical landscape? Alternatively,\nthey could be an amalgamation of many things.\n• What is their personality? Are they quick to dispatch\ntheir enemies, or do they toy with their victims? Are they\ncompletely loyal to Kudamat, or do they enjoy learning\nabout mortals? They could have many different aspects to\ntheir thinking and worldview.\n• How do they move? Do they lumber across the landscape,\nfly on feathered wings, or disappear into the earth and\nappear elsewhere? They could also utilize different forms\nof movement based on the terrain or situation.\n• What abilities do they have? They may attack many\nenemies at once with a flurry of arms, conjure an army\nof ravenous shadow beasts, or rip memories from the\nminds of their targets. Consider how they’d attack at their\nstrongest, but also how they’d act when they’re gravely\ninjured.\n• What is their weakness? Are they vulnerable to fire or\nanother element? Do they undergo a transformation that\nleaves them open to attack? Are they a pair of colossi who\nare strong together but weak when separated? Find ways\nto give the characters openings to defeat these larger-\nthan-life enemies.\n• How does the colossus relate to the themes the players\nwant to explore? You might create a colossus that\nanimates the dead if characters have experienced grief,\na colossus that grows plants wherever they step if the\ncampaign focuses on the destruction of the environment,\nor a colossus that corrodes all they touch if characters\nbegin to doubt if their actions are heroic.\nThe Soul Shards\nNo one knows exactly where each soul shard is located, but\nregions overrun with aberrations and supercharged essentia\nindicate that a shard is nearby. When Kudamat locates a\nsoul shard and begins siphoning power from it, the ground\naround it quakes with a single, powerful tremor, and the vein\nof essentia supercharged by his power glows brightly, day and\nnight. This helps the locals pinpoint the soul shard’s location\nwith more accuracy, so to prevent it from being found,\nKudamat simultaneously creates a sentinel: a colossus who\nstalks and guards that entire region.\nOnce a colossus is slain, the soul shard they defended shatters\ndeep beneath the earth, causing a ring of essentia to violently\nerupt out of the ground in a mile radius around the shard’s\nlocation. Destroying these shards prevents Kudamat from\nabsorbing further power—the sooner each shard is shattered,\nthe less power Kudamat will have when he emerges from\nthe mountain at the end of the campaign (see the upcoming\n“Emergence of Kudamat” section for more details).\nThe Aberrations\nFrom the divine power surging through the veins of essentia\ncome new and terrible beasts. These aberrations are smaller\nthan the colossi, but share the same goal: keep all creatures\naway from the soul shards. Some even resemble the colossi\nthey serve, wielding similar forms or abilities as their titanic\ncounterparts.\nAny existing adversaries can be reflavored as an aberration,\nbut you can build your own as well. When creating\naberrations, ask yourself the following questions:\n• What do they look like? Similar to the colossi, these are\ntwisted and terrible beings never before seen in the Mortal\nRealm. They usually resemble their surrounding landscape,\na characteristic they embody, or the colossi they serve.\n• Where can they be found? When you imagine them\nin the Drylands, consider how they might hunt in the\nenvironment they populate. These creatures range in size\nfrom miniscule to the size of a house, and each aberration\nwill operate differently.\n• What powers do they have? Do they resemble a nearby\ncolossus? Or are they something else entirely? Some\nof the aberrations might fight in packs, have only one\npowerful ability, or wear the party down with sheer\nnumbers.\nEssentia\nAll magic in the Drylands is powered by essentia, and without\nthe crystals and batteries made from them, magic users\ncannot access this power. Had the life forces of the Forgotten\nGods not crystallized on the Mortal Plane, its inhabitants\nwould never have harnessed the power of magic. Across the\nrealm, since the dawn of mortalkind, people have mined the\nearth and plumbed the seas for these crystals of power. But\nit’s only within the recent past that people learned that, while\nthe raw essentia crystals can provide enormous power, it’s\nmore reliable (and often a more efficient use of less-potent\nstones) to manufacture batteries. These “essentia cells” are\nnow widely available across the realm, making magic more\naccessible and the Drylands increasingly wealthy.\nAsk players about their character’s relationship with essentia.\n• Are they willing to harness the life essence of ancient\ngods, or do they consider it a profanity?\n• Do they install raw or polished essentia crystals in their\narmor or weapons, or do they utilize modern essentia\ncells?\n• How do they acquire new essentia when their crystals or\ncells wear out? Do they purchase it in shops, steal it, or\nmine it as they travel?\nCOLOSSUS OF THE DRYLANDS\n315\tChapter 5: Colossus of the Drylands\n\n-- 316 of 415 --\n\nDrylands Outposts\nSince the Essentia Rush began about 40 years ago,\nsettlements like Wyllin’s Gulch formed around Godfell\nMountain. Some are small encampments, while others are\nbustling towns cut through by dirt streets. But no matter their\nsize, they’re always referred to as outposts, because everyone\nknows that once the local essentia veins are cleaned out,\npeople will have their town packed up overnight.\nBelow are a few of the larger outposts, but you’re encouraged\nto make your own:\nThe Cinderline: Named for the unique black sand the town\nis built upon, the Cinderline sprung up around a river that\nwashed bits of essentia into a nice deposit downstream,\nthough no one has successfully panned for essentia in the\nlast few years. Locals are fiercely protective of their water\nsupply, as this outpost is the last stop for fresh water\nbefore a long stretch of desert.\nHavalaugh: The name sounds as cordial as the folks in this\nencampment. Though there isn’t a permanent building in\nsight, the tents that form this town stretch for at least a\nmile. Run by someone known only as Pickens (they/them),\nHavalaugh is fairly receptive to outsiders. The outpost is\nconsidered to host the premier marketplace on the eastern\nside of the mountain, and its High Summer Festival is\nfamous—enough for Havalaugh to nearly quintuple its size\nfor a week. There’s no sheriff in Havalaugh, but anyone who\nharms a citizen is never heard from again.\nThe Iron Kettle: One of the more industrialized outposts in\nthe region, the Iron Kettle is built around a massive mine\nowned by Iron Tusk Corp. Because of the talent needed to\nconstruct the mining infrastructure, it’s a rustic place full\nof skilled smiths and crafters, many of whom sell goods\nto travelers outside their work for Iron Tusk. This need for\nsteel goods has given the smiths more power than Iron\nTusk would prefer. But a powerful trade union formed by\nthe smiths keeps them in check and governs “The Kettle,”\ntaking the onus (and liability) off the company.\nPryor: Built into a long-abandoned essentia mine, Pryor is\noften unnoticed by those who don’t know where to look as\nthey ride by. The folk that live in this insular outpost are\nnot known to welcome guests, but if you have a contact\nwho can get you in their good graces, you’re likely to learn\nthe best tricks of the Drylands from the citizens of Pryor.\nMost of these families stretch back to the time before the\nEssentia Rush, when there were only a few folk mining\nthese lands.\nDefiance: Famous for its position high atop a mesa,\nDefiance is an outpost rumored to have been established\nby a band of thieves looking to escape the law—and its\nposition certainly provides a good view of anyone coming\ntheir way. These vagrants have a considerable cache of\nartillery aimed at the ground below, and they aren’t known\nto fire warning shots.\nTHE INCITING INCIDENT\nYou can use the prompt below to start your campaign, or\ncreate your own.\nWhen the first colossus rose outside Wyllin’s Gulch, most\npeople spent a considerable amount of time panicking.\nThe sheriff raised a small army to fight it, a band of brave\nminers piled old equipment in its path, and the factories\nshuttered to protect their stores of essentia. But every effort\nwas ineffective in stopping the massive creature’s path of\ndestruction\nAfter seeing most of his deputies die in a single crushing\nblow, Mayor Logan Hartly (she/her) put out an ad. “Help\nWanted. Whoever can dispatch the colossus and its pack of\nabberations will receive a chest of fully processed essentia.”\nIt’s a good deal for anyone who can manage to fight the\ngigantic force of nature and live to tell the tale.\nMeanwhile, Baron Ryder Destry (he/him)—his name, not\na title—recently learned that Kudamat’s efforts to siphon\nthe power of his soul has supercharged the veins of essentia\nconnected to the shard, making the stones ten times as\nvaluable. He’s offering “an army’s supply of powerful essentia”\nto anyone who will collaborate with the colossus to stand\nguard around the soul shard until Kudamat completes his\nritual. Destry swears his factory guard can keep Wyllin’s Gulch\nsafe, and he’ll keep his teams mining the powerful essentia\nnight and day.\nThe party was assembled by the mayor’s “Help Wanted” ad,\nbut Destry’s offer put more than a few wrenches in an already\nnear-impossible plan. Numerous groups with their eye on\nDestry’s prize are already on their way to the colossus to help\nit guard Kudamat’s soul shard. In addition, smaller aberrations\nhave begun to rise from the veins of essentia to aid their\ntitanic counterpart. If the party can manage to fight their way\nthrough these smaller adversaries, they’ll have to topple a\ncolossus, a feat no one in the Drylands has ever accomplished.\nWill the party take the offer from the mayor, or give up the\neffort to stand alongside the colossus while Destry continues\nto mine the supercharged essentia? Can they play both\nsides? Will Hartly keep her word if they manage to topple\nthe colossus? Can the party kill the massive creation before\nit destroys Wyllin’s Gulch, or any of the smaller outposts\nnearby? Once they’ve destroyed this colossus, are the stories\ntrue, with another rise to fulfill the Prophecy of the Drylands?\nCOLOSSUS OF THE DRYLANDS\n316 \tChapter 5: Colossus of the Drylands\n\n-- 317 of 415 --\n\nCOLOSSUS OF THE DRYLANDS\nCAMPAIGN MECHANICS\nThe following mechanics are unique to this campaign.\nTools of the Trade\nFrom firearms to dynamite, the Drylands’ communities have developed impressive technology thanks to the Essentia Rush.\nEncourage PCs to reflavor any of the standard equipment and loot as something appropriate for the genre.

Dynamite deals double damage to inanimate objects or structures.\n317\tChapter 5: Colossus of the Drylands\n\n-- 318 of 415 --\n\nHunts and Interludes\nPlay in this campaign frame is broken into two distinct\nphases—hunts and interludes.\nOnce the party finds out a new colossus has risen in the\nDrylands, they are in the hunt phase. During the hunt phase,\nthey should be riding into the relevant outpost, gathering\ninformation they need for their hunt, saving innocents from\nnewly released aberrations, tracking down the colossus, and\nbattling them. During a hunt, the threat of the colossus should\nalways feel present, even from a distance. A hunt might last a\nfew days to a week, but it should feel as though every moment\ncounts as Kudamat siphons power from his soul shard and the\ncolossus wreaks havoc.\nOnce the colossus is slain, the party moves into the interlude\nphase. During the interlude phase, PCs have time to take\non smaller, more personal tasks throughout the region—\nperhaps a band of ruffians keeps robbing people outside the\nlocal saloon, a train was derailed by an eruption of essentia\nand is now missing, or a farmer’s cattle keep was devoured\nby something strange in the night. An interlude might last a\nfew days to a few weeks or more, depending on the players’\ndesires.\nColossal Adversaries\nThis campaign frame introduces a unique adversary type:\nColossus. If you are running this campaign, you’ll need to\nbuild colossi for your party to fight. This section provides\nsome Colossus adversary examples, as well as guidance for\nhow to design and run your own.\nColossus Stat Blocks\nBecause they’re so large, colossi use multiple adversary stat\nblocks, each one representing a segment of their form. For\nexample, you might decide you want to build out Ikeri, Injuries\nUntold. You could divide their segments into six stat blocks:\ntwo legs, two arms, a torso, and a head. Additionally, these\nsegment stat blocks exist within the colossus framework, a\nstat block that holds the information and features that apply\nto the colossus as a whole.\nSome segments can be Broken. While Broken, the segment\ncan't use actions or reactions until the condition is cleared.\nWhen a segment marks its last Hit Point, it’s considered\nDestroyed. A Destroyed segment can no longer use any of its\nfeatures. A colossus is defeated when all their segments are\nDestroyed, but colossi often have an alternative way to be\ndefeated, as well. When a segment is Destroyed, that doesn’t\nmean it’s gone or detached—it simply doesn’t work anymore.\nYou can use the following Tier 1 stat block as your party’s\nfirst colossus encounter, and it also serves as a template you\ncan use to make your own colossi. The sections after the Tier\n1 colossus stat blocks provide additional feature examples,\nguidance for running colossi, and more example stat blocks at\nhigher tiers.\nCOLOSSUS OF THE DRYLANDS\n318 \tChapter 5: Colossus of the Drylands\n\n-- 319 of 415 --\n\nCOLOSSUS OF THE DRYLANDS\nIKERI, INJURIES UNTOLD\nTier  Colossus\nThis apelike creature has the face of a bird. They are made of stone\nand carry an enormous mesa upon their back.\nMotives & Tactics: Entangle, intimidate, peck stomp\nSize: 95 ft. tall, 60 ft. wide\nSegments: 2 Legs, 2 Arms, 1 Torso, and 1 Head\nThresholds: 11/22 | Stress: 6\nExperience: Eagle Eyes +3, Huge +2\nFEATURES\nColossal Power - Reaction: When Ikeri fails an attack, you gain a\nFear.\nSwatting Pests - Reaction: When Ikeri is attacked by a fl ying target\nwithin Far range, you can make a Peck (Head) or Punch (Arm)\nstandard attack against the attacker. On a success, add a d20 to\nthe damage roll and the target is knocked to the ground at the\nfeet of the colossus.\nIKERI HEAD\nAdjacent Segments: Torso\nDifficulty: 16 | HP: 5\nATK: +2 | Peck: Melee | 1d10+1 phy\nFEATURES\nFatal - Passive: When the Head is Destroyed, Ikeri is defeated.\nStrike (Melee) - Passive: The Head is immune to damage from\nattacks not made within Melee range.\nFollow-Up - Reaction: When the Head succeeds on an attack\nagainst a target, it can immediately make an attack against\nanother target it hasn’t attacked during this GM turn.\n319\tChapter 5: Colossus of the Drylands\nIKERI ARM (2)\nAdjacent Segments: Torso\nDifficulty: 13 | HP: 3 (each)\nATK: +2 | Punch: Very Close | 1d8+6 phy\nFEATURES\nChain (A) - Passive: When all segments in Chain A are Destroyed,\nIkeri is defeated.\nCrush - Action: Spend a Fear to make an attack against a target on\nanother segment of Ikeri. On a success, Ikeri grabs and crushes\nthe target, dealing 1d20+4 physical damage and Restraining\nthem until this Arm takes Major or greater damage. When this\nArm takes the spotlight while the target is still in Ikeri’s hand, the\ntarget takes 1d20 physical damage.\nIKERI LEG (2)\nAdjacent Segments: Torso, Leg\nDifficulty: 13 | HP: 3 (each)\nATK: +2 | Stomp: Very Close | 1d6+3 phy\nFEATURES\nChain (A) - Passive: When all segments in Chain A are Destroyed,\nIkeri is defeated.\nMassive Stomp - Action: Spend a Fear to make a standard attack\nwith advantage against a group.\nIKERI TORSO\nAdjacent Segments: Head, Arms, Legs\nDifficulty: 14 | HP: 8\nFEATURES\nFatal - Passive: When the Torso is Destroyed, Ikeri is defeated.\nShake Off - Action: Spend a Fear to throw off foes. All creatures\non Ikeri must make a Strength Reaction Roll. Targets who fail fall\nto the ground and must mark a HP. Targets who succeed must\nmark a Stress.\n\n-- 320 of 415 --\n\nCOLOSSUS OF THE DRYLANDS\nEXAMPLE FEATURES\nThe following list of features are designed specifically for\nColossus adversaries, and we encourage you to add the ones\nyou like to all the colossi you build for your campaign.\nPASSIVES\nThe following are examples of passive features.\nFatal - Passive: When this segment is Destroyed, the colossus\nis defeated.\nChain - Passive: When all segments in this chain are\nDestroyed, the colossus is defeated.\nThis feature might appear as Chain (A) or Chain (B) for\nclarity across multiple segment chains.\nStrike (Melee) - Passive: This segment is immune to damage\nfrom attacks not made within Melee range.\nMelee could be replaced with any range to change up this\nfeature.\nArmored - Passive: When this segment marks HP from an\nattack, it marks 1 fewer HP.\nClimbing (+3) - Passive: This segment’s Difficulty gains a +3\nbonus against action rolls made to climb it.\nThis could also be a negative number, such as –3, which\nwould mean the Difficulty to climb is reduced.\nNot Climbable - Passive: This segment can’t be climbed.\nWeak Point - Passive: The colossus has a weak point on this\nsegment. When this segment marks HP from an attack made\nwithin Melee range, it marks an additional HP.\nTypically, hitting the weak point of a segment while within\nMelee range causes the colossus to mark an additional HP,\nbut hitting weak points can have other effects! Feel free to\nexperiment with other outcomes. Maybe that segment can’t\nbe used for a few GM turns, or its damage is halved the next\ntime it’s spotlighted.\nACTIONS\nThe following are examples of action features.\nShake Off - Action: Spend a Fear to throw off foes. All\ncreatures on the colossus must make a Strength Reaction\nRoll. Targets who fail fall to the ground and must mark a HP.\nTargets who succeed must mark a Stress.\nKudamat’s Rage - Action: Spend 2 Fear to force all PCs within\nVery Far range to succeed on a Presence Reaction Roll or\nbecome Shaken. While Shaken, they don't gain Hope on a\nresult with Hope and instead clear the Shaken condition.\nREACTIONS\nThe following are examples of reaction features.\nSwatting Pests - Reaction: When the colossus is attacked by a\nflying target within Far range, you can make a standard attack\nagainst the attacker. On a success, add a d20 to the damage\nroll and the target is knocked to the ground within Far range.\nCollapsed - Reaction: When the colossus marks at least\n1 HP on all Leg segments, it Collapses. While the colossus is\nCollapsed, segments that aren’t accessible from the ground\ncan be climbed.\nThis reaction is typically used in conjunction with the “Not\nClimbable” passive feature. You can always change the\ntrigger out for something that makes more sense within the\nfiction as it occurs.\nColossal Power - Reaction: When the colossus fails an attack,\nyou gain a Fear.\nSegment vs. Colossus Effects\nWhen a feature refers to a specific segment’s name, such\nas “the Head,” it’s only referring to that specific part of the\ncolossus. For example, the Head might be immune to physical\nattacks or be more difficult to climb. When a feature refers\nto the colossus’s name, such as “Ikeri,” it’s talking about the\nadversary as a whole. For example, a reaction feature might\ntrigger an attack after Ikeri marks 2 or more Hit Points from\na single attack. This would mean that when any segment\nmarks 2 or more Hit Points from a single attack, the reaction\nis triggered.\nAdjacent Segments\nMake sure to note which segments are adjacent to one\nanother. When climbing on a colossus, PCs will only be able\nto traverse segments that are adjacent (see the upcoming\n“Moving PCs Around a Colossus” section).\n320 \tChapter 5: Colossus of the Drylands\n\n-- 321 of 415 --\n\nCOLOSSUS OF THE DRYLANDS\nBuilding Colossi as a Puzzle\nWhen approaching creating a colossus, consider how you\ncan make them more than just a bag of Hit Points to strike\nuntil they die. Perhaps certain segments can only be attacked\nonce other segments are Destroyed, or each segment has\nits own damage thresholds, or a certain parameter has to\nbe satisfied before the colossus can be hit at all. Maybe the\ncolossus only takes Major damage, ignoring other severities,\nor is only harmed by a certain type of weapon, requiring the\nparty to hunt down those weapons before the fight. The\nearlier example features, particularly the passives, can help\nyou create these puzzles, but feel free to invent your own.\nAs you become more comfortable with epic-scale fights, we\nencourage you to ramp up the adversaries to your preferred\nlevel of complexity—but don’t be afraid to start simple!\nRunning Colossus Fights\nBecause of the scale of the fight, battles against colossi have\nsome unique rules to use and guidance to follow.\nSCALE\nUnlike normal range in Daggerheart, we use a standard form\nof measurement when talking about a colossus’s scale. (In\nour case, we use feet—but you should use whatever you find\neasiest.) Normal range bands still apply when taking actions\nand are at GM discretion as usual, but expressing the height or\nwidth of a creature through recognizable sizes helps the table to\nunderstand the scale of the colossus they’re facing.\nMOVING PCS AROUND A COLOSSUS\nDuring an encounter, it’s expected that PCs will scale the\ncolossus. Rather than the normal movement rules, use the\nfollowing guidelines:\n• PCs can climb onto each colossus segment unless a\nsegment notes otherwise in its stat block.\n• Once a PC is on a segment, they can usually move around\nthat segment of the colossus without having to make\nadditional rolls.\n• To move to an adjacent segment, the PC must make the\nappropriate action roll (usually Agility or Strength) to leap\nonto it.\nTEAMWORK\nWhile fighting a colossus, PCs may initiate any number of Tag\nTeam Rolls.\nUSING A COLOSSUS IN BATTLE\nOn your GM turn, treat each segment of a colossus as its own\nadversary when moving the spotlight. You can spotlight a\nsegment as your GM move, then spend a Fear to spotlight an\nadditional segment as you would during a fight with regular\nadversaries. Some colossi also have actions in their colossus\nframework; you can spotlight the framework to use this action\nas you would spotlight a segment, but you should highlight\nthe colossus as a whole in the narrative. You can still spotlight\nadditional segments on your turn.\nWhile a PC is on a segment of the colossus:\n• They have advantage on attacks against that segment.\n• The segment’s standard attack cannot be used on that PC.\nFor example, they can’t grab a PC who’s riding on their hand!\nThe colossus would need to use a different segment to attack\nthem. Any feature that allows a segment to attack a PC who’s\ncurrently on that segment will call it out in its description.\nFor example, the “Shake Off” feature specifies “all creatures\non the colossus,” meaning it would include creatures on that\nsegment.\nAny features that would pull or push normal adversaries can’t\nmove a colossus; instead, the feature pulls or pushes the PC\nmaking the attack. For example, using a grappler against a\ncolossus can’t pull them toward you, but instead pulls you\ntoward them. Any time an effect is targeting the colossus,\nuse the Difficulty of the segment being targeted. If an effect\ntargets a colossus as a collective, use the highest Difficulty\namongst all the segments. If a PC’s feature targets multiple\nadversaries, it can target multiple segments.\nTypically when fighting a colossus, there is no need to add\nadditional adversaries to the encounter—colossi are powerful\nenough on their own! If you do want to have other adversaries\ninvolved, think about their relationship with the colossus. Are\nthey an aberration? Do they find the colossus useful for their\nown purposes? We recommend keeping additional adversaries\nlimited and purposeful, or a fight can become unwieldy.\nLastly, give the characters information about how to take\ndown a colossus, and consider how that information can be\ncreatively delivered. Part of the hunt phase should include\nthe PCs tracking down knowledge about the colossus before\nfacing it; you’re encouraged to seed rumors from townspeople\nabout what they’ve seen, then provide payoff when some of\nthose rumors are proven true during the fight. Additionally,\nexamine the colossus’s stat block and plan ways you might\ngive clues about its physical body using color, light, and shape\nto telegraph important information. If you describe heavy\narmor that surrounds a delicate blue light pulsing in the core\nof the chest, they’ll have a pretty good idea where the weak\npoint is and the armor they need to contend with. Think\nabout how you can use all of a character’s senses to convey\nthe mechanics of the colossus and use them to narratively\nguide your players along the monstrous beast. For example,\nthis segment’s skin feels squishier than the other parts of this\ncreature they’ve been on, or the smell is getting more putrid\nthe higher they climb, or they can hear a shrill cry getting\nlouder as they move toward the tail.\n321\tChapter 5: Colossus of the Drylands\n\n-- 322 of 415 --\n\nCOLOSSUS OF THE DRYLANDS\nColossus Maps\nIf you’d like to use maps and minis to help you and the players maintain spacial awareness of a colossus fight, but you’re\nstruggling with how to represent the fight without a massive figurine, you can build out the basic shape of your colossus using\nnotecards, such as the following example visuals. When a PC climbs onto a segment of the colossus, place their miniature\ndirectly on the notecard. This setup can help you and the players remember where each PC is and which segments are adjacent\nto them. It can also help you visualize how you can use each segment’s features and shake up the battle.\nExample Colossi\nThe following stat blocks provide example colossi for each additional tier of play.\nDAKTADAE, THE CLEAVER\nTier  Colossus\nA massive steel rhinoceros formed from a steam train, a cleaver\nemerging from his head instead of a horn.\nMotives & Tactics: Clear forests, cleave, hew, stomp\nSize: 130 ft. tall, 220 ft. long\nSegments: 2 Forelegs, 2 Hindlegs, 1 Torso, and 1 Head\nThresholds: 16/25 | Stress: 6\nExperience: Huge +2, Trampling +2\nFEATURES\nSteam-Powered - Action: Scalding fountains of steam erupt from\nDaktadae’s form. Spotlight any segment to make an attack with\na +1 attack modifier against a target on that segment.

All PCs on Daktadae or within Close range must\nsucceed on an Instinct Reaction Roll (14) or take 2d20+5\nphysical damage; succeed or fail, the PCs are thrown off\nDaktadae onto the ground within Melee range of the colossus.\nSlow Recovery - Action: Clear a token from one Broken or Collapsed\nsegment.\nColossal Power - Reaction: When Ikeri fails an attack, you gain a\nFear.\nDAKTADAE HEAD\nAdjacent Segments: Torso\nDifficulty: 15 | HP: 5\nATK: +2 | Cleaver: Melee | 2d20+8 phy\nFEATURES\nInvulnerable - Passive: The Head can only take damage while it’s\nBroken.\nGodcleaver - Action: Make a standard attack against a target. On a\nsuccess, mark a Stress to deal 3d20+12 physical damage instead.\nHead Toss - Action: Mark a Stress and make a standard attack\nagainst all targets within range who are not on this segment or\nthe Torso. On a success, place 2 tokens on this segment. It is\nBroken until all tokens are cleared.\nCleaver Recovery - Reaction: After making a standard attack, place\na token on this segment.

Each class is made up of\ntwo domains. You choose your abilities and spells from\nthese domains.\nThis section gives you a place to record your name,\npronouns, heritage (the combination of your community\nand ancestry), and subclass. There is also a space to\nrecord your level.\nThis is where you record your Hope. You spend Hope to\nuse an Experience (details below), Help an Ally, use a\nHope Feature, or initiate a Tag Team Roll. When you\nHelp an Ally, you explain how you’re aiding them and roll\na d6 advantage die they add to their action roll total.\nYou start with 2 Hope marked.\nYour class’s unique Hope Feature is in this section as well.\nThis is where you keep track of your gold during a\ncampaign. If you would mark your tenth handful, you\ninstead mark a bag and erase all your handfuls. If you\nwould mark your tenth bag, you instead mark a chest\nand erase your bags. You start with one handful of\ngold.\nYour inventory is where you store items and consumables.\nEach class starts with a unique class feature that sets\nthem apart from other classes. Make sure to read through\nthem before you begin playing.\nThis is where you store weapons you want to carry but\nnot have active. While a weapon is in your inventory, you\ncan’t benefit from its feature.\nSLIDE THIS SIDE OUT TO THE RIGHT\nOF YOUR CHARACTER SHEET.\nSLIDE THIS SIDE OUT TO THE LEFT\nOF YOUR CHARACTER SHEET.\nExperience represents your character’s particular\nspecializations your character has. These are narrative\ntags that you create to reflect what your character is\nskilled in. When they apply to the scene, you can spend a\nHope before the action roll to add an Experience’s value\nas a modifier. You earn more Experiences throughout a\ncampaign.\nThis is the section for your armor. Along with a name,\narmor has base thresholds that contribute to your\ndamage thresholds, and a base score that contributes\nto your Armor Score. The armor’s feature describes its\nspecial abilities or the requirements to use it.\nEvasion represents your ability to avoid an attack. The\nGM rolls against this number when determining if an\nadversary hits you. If you do get hit, you can choose to\nmark an Armor Slot (the small empty shields to the right\nof the large “Armor” shield) to reduce the severity of the\nincoming damage by one threshold. You have a number\nof available slots equal to your Armor Score (the number\nin the large “Armor” shield).\nThis area contains your six character traits. You use\nthese as your primary modifiers on action rolls. The\ndescriptions beneath each trait remind you how to use\nthem.\nThe two smaller boxes are your damage thresholds.\nThese come from your armor, and you always add your\nlevel to their value. When you take damage, compare it to\nthe numbers here. If the incoming damage is Minor, you\nmark a Hit Point. If it is Major, you mark 2 Hit Points. If\nit is Severe, you mark 3 Hit Points. If you ever need to\nmark Stress and can’t, mark a Hit Point. If you ever mark\nyour last Hit Point, you must make a death move.\nThis is the section for your active weapons. Along with\na name, weapons have an associated trait that you roll\nwhen using them for an attack. They also have a range\n(Melee, Very Close, Close, Far, or Very Far). The GM tells\nyou what range a target is at relative to your character.\nDamage dice are the kind of dice you roll when you\nmake a successful attack, and the damage type is either\nphysical or magic. Proficiency tells you how many\ndamage dice you roll. A weapon’s feature describes its\nspecial abilities or the requirements to use it.\nWeapons are either one-handed or two-handed. Fill in\nthe appropriate number of hands based on the weapons\nyou take.\ncharacter sheet sidecar\n\n-- 345 of 415 --\n\ncharacter sheet\nmulticlass Sheet\nDaggerheart © Darrington Press 2025\nnotes\nDOMAIN\nDAGGERHEART\nWhen leveling up, you can take domain cards from this\ndomain at half your level or lower (rounded up).\nWhen you multiclass, take one of that class’s foundation cards\nand place it in your loadout.

Take the character\nsheet specific to this class.\nEach class has a number of subclasses to\nchoose from that help define what kind of\nfocus you’d like your character to have.\nTake the foundation card for your chosen\nsubclass.\nCHOOSE A HERITAGE\nYour character’s heritage is made up of\nboth an ancestry and a community card.\nThese two cards establish your character’s\nphysical appearance and the environment\nthey grew up in.\nASSIGN CHARACTER TRAITS\nDistribute the values −1, 0, 0, +1, +1, +2\nacross your character traits. When rolling,\nyou’ll add the value of that character trait\nto the roll.\nRECORD CHARACTER INFORMATION\nNext, record your starting Evasion.\nAdditionally, gain 2 Hope to start the\ngame.\nCHOOSE STARTING EQUIPMENT\nDecide which weapons you want to start\nthe game with and record their details\nin the appropriate spaces in the “Active\nWeapons” section.CHOOSE SMOR\nNext, take one of the available options for\nstarting armor and record its details in the\nappropriate spaces. Your armor comes\nwith its own damage thresholds and base\narmor score. Record this alongside your\nselection under “Active Armor.” Add your\nthresholds to your level and record those\nnumbers under the “Damage & Health”\nsection. Also record the Base Armor Score,\nplus modifiers from any features, in the\nlarge shield labeled “Armor” at the top of\nthe sheet.\nThe starting inventory for your class\nis listed on your character guide.\nRecord those items in the “Inventory”\nsection of your character sheet.\nCREATE YOUR BACKGROUND\nMake description choices from the\navailable options on your character guide\n(or create your own). This will help you\nstart to build out your character’s look and\nattitude.\nThen use the background questions on\nyour character guide as a jumping-off point\nto build out your character’s history (or\ncreate your own questions).\nFinally, name your character and choose\nwhich pronouns they use.\nCREATE YOUR EXPERIENCES\nUse all the choices and backstory\nyou’ve made about your character\nso far to generate their starting two\nExperiences, a set of narrative words\nor phrases that represent what they’ve\nlearned or become on their journey so far.\nAssign both a modifier of +2.\nCHOOSE DOMAIN DECK CARDS\nEach class is made up of two different\ndomains, which are listed below the class\nname on the character sheet. Choose two\ncards total from the level 1 cards in those\ndomains. You can share these decks with\nother players. If you do, make sure to\ntalk with them about which cards they’re\ninterested in.ANSWERND QUESTIONS\nCREATE CONNECTIONS\nAsk any of the Connection questions\non your character guide to the other\nplayers at the table (or generate your own\nquestions). Use this as an opportunity to\nalso discuss how your characters all met,\nwhat brought them together, and why\nthey’ve decided to travel as a party.\n1\n2\n3\n4\n6\n5 \t7\n8\n9\n\n-- 347 of 415 --\n\nDOWNTIME\nACTION ROLLS\nDowntime represents moments of respite within the perilous journey the characters are on together. It’s\nnot only an opportunity to recover and prepare for what lies ahead, but also a time to share more quiet,\nintimate scenes that help to build or showcase the relationships characters have with one another.\nLevel 1 \tTier 1 \tLevels 2–4 \tTier 2 \tLevels 5–7 \tTier 3 \tLevels 8–10 \tTier 4\nACTION ROLL RESULTS\n• On a critical success, you get what you want and\na little extra. You gain a Hope and clear a Stress.\n• On a success with Hope, you pull it off well and\nget what you want. You gain a Hope.\n• On a success with Fear, you get what you want,\nbut it comes with a cost or consequence. You\nmight get attacked, get limited information, attract\ndanger, or face another complication. The GM gains\na Fear.\n• On a failure with Hope, things don’t go to plan.\nYou probably don’t get what you want and there are\nconsequences, but you gain a Hope.\n• On a failure with Fear, things go very badly. You\nprobably don’t get what you want, and a major\nconsequence or complication occurs because of it.\nThe GM gains a Fear.\nDAMAGE ROLLS\nAfter a successful attack, roll a number of your\nweapon’s damage dice equal to your Proficiency and\nadd them together.\nIf your attack roll critically succeeds, your attack\ndeals extra damage! Start with the highest possible\nvalue the damage dice can roll, and then make a\ndamage roll as usual, adding it to that value.\nReaction rolls\nReaction rolls work similarly to action rolls, except\nthey don’t generate Hope, Fear, or additional GM\nmoves.\nUSING ARMOR\nYour Armor Score represents how many Armor Slots\nyou have available. When you take damage, you\ncan mark an Armor Slot to reduce the severity by\none threshold. You can only mark 1 Armor Slot per\nincoming attack.\nQUICK REFERENCE\nAdvantage: Add a d6 advantage die to your roll.\nDisadvantage: Subtract a d6 disadvantage die from\nyour roll.\nHelp an Ally: Spend a Hope and roll a d6 advantage\ndie to add to an ally’s roll. If the ally has gained\nadvantage on a roll from multiple sources, they only\nadd the highest result to their roll.\nGroup Action: Nominate a leader of the action. All\nother participants in the group action roll make a\nreaction roll using whichever traits they and the\nGM decide best fit (they don’t need to use the same\ntraits). The leader then makes an action roll. Their\naction roll gains a +1 bonus for each reaction roll that\nsucceeds and a −1 penalty for each reaction roll that\nfails.\nTag Team Roll: Once per session, each player can\nchoose to spend 3 Hope and initiate a Tag Team\nRoll between their character and another PC. When\nyou do, work with the other character’s player to\ndescribe how you combine your actions in a unique\nand exciting way. You both make separate action\nrolls, but before resolving the roll’s outcome, choose\none of the rolls to apply for both of your results. On a\nroll with Hope, all PCs involved gain a Hope. On a roll\nwith Fear, the GM gains a Fear for each PC involved.\nIf you succeed on a Tag Team Roll attack, you both\nroll damage, then add it together to determine the\ndamage dealt.\nVulnerable: When a creature has the Vulnerable\ncondition, all rolls against them have advantage.\nRestrained: When a creature has the Restrained\ncondition, they can’t move, but they can still take\nactions from their current position.\nHidden: While you’re out of sight from all foes and\nthey don’t know where you are, you gain the Hidden\ncondition. While you’re Hidden, any rolls against you\nhave disadvantage.\nDirect Damage: Armor Slots can’t be marked to\nreduce this damage.\nCritical Success!\nIf the Hope and Fear Die both\nland on the same number,\nit’s a critical success.\nSHORT REST\nEach player can swap any domain cards in their loadout for cards\nin their vault, then choose two of the following moves (or choose\nthe same move twice). The GM gains 1d4 Fear.\n• Tend to Wounds\nDescribe how you hastily patch yourself up, then clear a number\nof Hit Points equal to 1d4 + your tier. You can do this to an ally\ninstead.\n• Clear Stress\nDescribe how you blow off steam or pull yourself together, then\nclear a number of Stress equal to 1d4 + your tier.\n• Repair Armor\nDescribe how you quickly repair your armor, then clear a number\nof Armor Slots equal to 1d4 + your tier. You can do this to an\nally’s armor instead.\n• Prepare\nDescribe how you prepare yourself for the path ahead, then gain\na Hope. If you choose to Prepare with one or more members of\nyour party, you each gain 2 Hope.\nLONG REST\nEach player can swap any domain cards in their loadout for cards in their vault, then choose\ntwo of the following moves (or choose the same move twice). The GM gains an amount of\nFear equal to the number of PCs + 1d4 and can advance a long-term countdown.\n• Tend to All Wounds\nDescribe how you patch yourself up, then clear all Hit Points.\nYou can do this to an ally instead.\n• Clear All Stress\nDescribe how you blow off steam or pull yourself together, then clear all Stress.\n• Repair All Armor\nDescribe how you spend time repairing your armor, then clear all Armor Slots.\nYou can do this to an ally’s armor instead.\n• Prepare\nDescribe how you prepare for the next day’s adventure, then gain a Hope. If you choose to\nPrepare with one or more members of your party, you each gain 2 Hope.\n• Work on a Project\nEstablish or continue work on a project. The GM might ask for a\nroll to determine how much to tick down the progress countdown.\nPLAY GUIDE\n12\n\t6\n6\n\t6\nRoll your Duality Dice and add them\ntogether along with your modifiers.\nDecide which modifiers apply.\nSpend a Hope to add an Experience.\nDescribe what you want to do and work\nwith the GM to determine whether a roll is\nnecessary to accomplish it.
