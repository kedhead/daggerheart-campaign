During your journeys, you may find yourself rubbing elbows with nobles to investigate and stop an assassination plot, delving into an ancient dungeon to prevent an apocalyptic creature from breaking free, sailing across a vast ocean to face a terrifying sea monster, or preventing a precious relic from falling into the hands of a dangerous enemy. No matter the adventure your party embarks upon, Daggerheart provides the tools to tell a story that is both heartfelt and epic. WHAT IS A TABLETOP ROLEPLAYING GAME? A tabletop roleplaying game, or TTRPG, is an interactive storytelling experience where players take on the roles of characters within a shared world and collaborate to tell a story about those characters. Daggerheart is meant to be played by three to six people—known as your group or table—with one person taking on the role of the game master (or GM) while the others each play a single character, referred to as a player character (or PC). The GM facilitates the story that takes shape around the PCs—they introduce rewards, complications, and consequences to the narrative, embody the story’s other characters (also known as non-player characters or NPCs), and help the story progress each time you play together. Like many roleplaying games, Daggerheart uses dice to determine the outcome of some uncertain events, providing an element of unpredictability to the results of choices you make. Even so, the game embraces player agency and imagination; the type of character you choose to play and the decisions you make about their background and experiences will make your odds better (or worse!) on those dice rolls. WHAT KIND OF ROLEPLAYING GAME IS DAGGERHEART? Daggerheart is a heroic, narrative-focused experience that features combat as a prominent aspect of play. The system facilitates emotionally engaging, player-driven stories punctuated by exciting battles and harrowing challenges. The game takes a fiction-first approach, encouraging players and GMs to act in good faith with one another and focus on the story they’re telling rather than the complexity of the mechanics. The rules provide structure when it’s unclear how actions or moments will resolve within that story. The system takes a free-flowing approach to combat to avoid slowing the game down with granular rounds, and it doesn’t rely on grid- based movement for maps and minis. These aspects coalesce to create a game that allows for the terrain and map-building that miniature-based systems are known for while facilitating a streamlined, narrative experience for players. If you’re looking for a TTRPG that tells heroic fantasy stories with a modern approach to mechanics, focusing on both epic battles and the emotional narrative of the characters who fight in them, you’ve come to the right place. Daggerheart also utilizes an asymmetrical design, meaning that it plays differently for the GM than it does for the players. Players roll two twelve-sided dice for their PCs’ standard actions, including their attacks. The GM can make most moves without dice, but they roll a twenty-sided die for adversary moves that require a roll. This asymmetrical design is intended to help all participants contribute to a memorable experience for everyone at the table. HEART OF THE GAME In Daggerheart, you and your fellow players all take turns describing what your characters do. The GM determines the consequences of those actions, then guides the group into collaboratively evolving the narrative because of those consequences. When the rules call for it, or when a situation demands, you’ll roll the dice to inform what happens next. Depending on the result of the roll, the events of the ongoing story will unfold in new and unexpected ways. There is no winning or losing in Daggerheart in the traditional “gaming” sense. The game is a collaborative storytelling experience, where the goal is to play out an incredible story together. Even if the characters fail to achieve their goals right away, make big mistakes, or even die, they never “lose.” If a character dies, the party can look for a way to bring them back to life, or that player can make a new character for the party to meet along their journey. If the group fails to stop the villain from enacting a terrible plan, they might face the consequences of that failure and try to make it right. If they succeed, they may triumphantly win the day—or they might anger or embolden an even stronger enemy who retaliates. No matter what happens during the story, as long as you’re working together to craft a narrative that is fun and exciting to everyone, you’ve already won. 4 Introduction"

Below is an abridged list of media the design team drew from while crafting this game. TTRPGs: 13th Age from Pelgrane Press, Apocalypse Keys from Evil Hat Productions, Apocalypse World from Lumpley Games, Blades in the Dark from Evil Hat Productions, City of Mist from Son of Oak Game Studio, Cortex Prime from Fandom Tabletop, Cypher System from Monte Cook Games, Dishonored from Modiphius Entertainment, Dungeons & Dragons from Wizards of the Coast, Flee, Mortals! from MCDM Productions, For the Queen from Darrington Press, Genesys from Fantasy Flight Games, Lady Blackbird from One Seven Design, Masks: A New Generation from Magpie Games, Pathfinder from Paizo Publishing, Shadowrun from Catalyst Game Labs, The Quiet Year from Buried Without Ceremony, The Wildsea from Mythopoeia Games Publications, Slugblaster from Mythopoeia Games Publications. Books: Sabriel by Garth Nix, A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin, The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien, The Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan, A Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula K. Le Guin. Films and Television: The Dragon Prince, The Legend of Vox Machina, The Lord of the Rings, The Witcher, Guardians of the Galaxy, The Dark Crystal. Video Games: Borderlands from Gearbox Software, Dragon Age: Inquisition from BioWare, The Elder Scrolls series from Bethesda Game Studios, Outriders from People Can Fly. Special Appreciation: • The Genesys System from Fantasy Flight Games was a major inspiration for the two-axis results of the Duality Dice. • Cypher System from Monte Cook Games and its GM Intrusions paved the way for spending Fear to interrupt a scene. • Among many other things, Wizards of the Coast’s Dungeons & Dragons advantage/disadvantage system was particularly inspirational in the dice mechanics of this game. • 13th Age from Pelgrane Press developed Backgrounds that heavily inspired the Experience mechanic. • Blades in the Dark from Evil Hat Productions and Apocalypse World from Lumpley Games helped shape the narrative flow of the game, and their playbooks inspired a lot of the character sheet development. • The Wildsea from Mythopoeia Games Publications and its phenomenal section on Reaches provided inspiration for the Campaign Frames section of this book. • The design of Wizards of the Coast’s Dungeons & Dragons fourth edition and the monster design of Flee, Mortals! from MCDM Productions informed the enemy types and ways of managing minions. • The Quiet Year from Buried Without Ceremony inspired the map-building section of this book’s campaign guidance. • Apocalypse Keys from Evil Hat Productions informed the sample session zero structure. CORE MECHANICS OVERVIEW The dice players use in Daggerheart most commonly fall into two different categories—your Duality Dice and your damage dice. Your Duality Dice are two differently colored twelve- sided dice (or d12s) that represent Hope and Fear. These dice embody the fate of the world and its effect on the characters’ success. Your damage dice correspond to the weapon or spell your character wields, expressing the deadliness of a successful attack. When you roll to see whether your character succeeds or fails at a task or challenge, you roll your Duality Dice and take the sum of their results, then add any bonuses your character has that apply to the action. If that total is equal to or higher than the Difficulty set by the GM, your character succeeds. If it’s lower, they fail. You’ll also tell the GM whether your Hope or Fear Die rolled higher, as the situation around you changes based on that result. We’ll discuss this more in-depth in the “Core Mechanics” section of chapter 2. SESSIONS AND CAMPAIGNS When the GM and players gather to play Daggerheart, that game is called a session. Each session is a small story, and if the group plays more sessions, those small stories become part of a larger narrative known as a campaign. Longer campaigns may be broken into arcs—multiple sessions collectively focused on a specific part of the story. If overthrowing a corrupt ruler is a campaign, recruiting allies from a neighboring kingdom is an arc within that campaign. Daggerheart is built to accommodate many kinds of stories. Your group might enjoy playing an open-ended campaign that lasts months, meeting every week to continue your characters’ stories indefinitely, or you could designate a set number of sessions and play with a definite end point. Your group might enjoy a short ten- session romp with a party of characters before making new ones, or you may only want to play one session, known as a “one-shot.” All of those options are wonderful ways to play—do what works best for your group. 6 Introduction"

The rules included in this book are designed to help you enjoy the experience at the table, but everyone has a different approach to interpreting rules and telling stories. The rules should never get in the way of the story you want to tell, the characters you want to play, or the adventures you want to have. As long as your group agrees, everything can be adjusted to fit your play style. If there’s a rule you’d rather ignore or modify, feel free to implement any change with your table’s consent. RULINGS OVER RULES While playing Daggerheart, the GM and players should always prioritize rulings over rules. This book offers answers for many questions your table may have about the game, but it won’t answer all of them. When you’re in doubt about how a rule applies, the GM should make a ruling that aligns with the narrative. For example, Daggerheart has a weapon called a grappler that lets you pull a target close to you. If you try to use it to pull an entire castle, the weapon text doesn’t forbid you from doing that—but it doesn’t make sense within the narrative. Instead, the GM might rule that you pull a few bricks out, or pull yourself toward the wall instead. Similarly, if your character does something that would logically result in immediate death—such as diving into an active volcano without protection—you might not get to make one of Daggerheart’s death moves, which normally give you control of your character’s fate in their final moments. This kind of consequence should be made clear before the action is completed, and it should always follow the logic of the world. As a narrative-focused game, Daggerheart is not a place where technical, out-of-context interpretations of the rules are encouraged. Everything should flow back to the fiction, and the GM has the authority and responsibility to make rulings about how rules are applied to underscore that fiction. Using This Book The Daggerheart Core Rulebook is divided into five chapters. CHAPTER ONE: PREPARING FOR ADVENTURE This chapter covers everything you need to know to make a character in the Daggerheart system. CHAPTER TWO: PLAYING AN ADVENTURE This chapter details the core game mechanics you’ll need to play a session, as well as how to level up your character, multiclass to access new domains, and use special equipment you might discover during play. CHAPTER THREE: RUNNING AN ADVENTURE This chapter is specifically for the GM, giving you the tools you’ll need to run sessions and campaigns. In addition to detailing the core GM mechanics, this chapter guides you on using safety tools, running session zero, customizing campaign maps, planning story arcs, and more. CHAPTER FOUR: ADVERSARIES AND ENVIRONMENTS This chapter provides rules and stat blocks for filling your world with challenging adversaries and dynamic environments. You can use the pregenerated adversary and environment stat blocks, or follow this chapter’s guidance to create your own. CHAPTER FIVE: CAMPAIGN FRAMES This chapter provides campaign frame options you can use to structure long-term play. APPENDIX Lastly, this is where domain card text, character sheets, character guides, maps, and all other reference documentation for the game can be found. 7 Introduction"

Most of the tools required to play a session of Daggerheart are included with this book, but there are a few additional components you’ll need to gather before you begin. 2–5 PLAYERS Daggerheart runs best with two to five players who are excited to collaborate and build a story together. If you’re playing a PC, your responsibility is to adopt the mentality of your character and decide what they do. The GM will present problems and obstacles, and you’ll figure out how to tackle those challenges in a way that makes your game most interesting. As a player, it’s your job to shape your character’s story through the choices you make and spotlight the other characters as they, too, grow on this journey. A GAME MASTER If you’re taking on the role of the GM, you’ll be playing the world as it responds to the PCs’ actions. That means you’ll set exciting scenes for the characters, manage the flow of the story, and play any NPCs, including the adversaries the characters will face. You’ll also ask the players questions that drive the narrative forward. Often, you’ll be the one who knows the rules and can answer questions about mechanics during play. If a judgment needs to be made during a session about a rule or mechanic that’s not in the rulebook, you’ll be the one to make that decision. As a GM, it’s important to remember that you’re not an antagonistic force against the players. Though you’re the one introducing the dangers and complications in a scene, the thrilling challenges you provide are meant to let the players showcase their characters’ strengths and face their characters’ flaws. Be a fan of the characters and a collaborator with the other players at your table. GAME DICE Daggerheart uses the full suite of polyhedral dice: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, and d100. When referring to a quantity of dice beyond a single die, the game indicates how many and which kind, such as 2d6 (two six-sided dice) or 3d8 (three eight-sided dice). Players will need 2d12 of different colors (your Duality Dice) and at least one set of polyhedral dice to share amongst the table. You may find it easier for each person to have their own set. As your character levels up, you’ll be rolling more dice to represent those advancements, so it may be helpful to bring another set or two. The GM will also need their own set of dice to run adversaries. TOKENS Character tokens are small objects that represent the look and feel of your character. Gather about seven tokens per player to start. You will need more as your character levels up—while the amount varies depending on the character build, you likely won’t need more than fifteen tokens at level 10. As you play the game, you’ll use these tokens to help track several things: • When you roll dice, you’ll add tokens to help you easily count the modifiers on the roll. • To use certain features, you might be required to place tokens on the card or character sheet. These tokens not only make your rolls easier to resolve, but they also provide an opportunity to further express the style and color palette of your character. You can use any small object (plastic gems, pennies, buttons), but we recommend something no larger than a quarter that can sit on the table without rolling away. Ideally, each player’s tokens should be visually distinct to avoid confusion. The GM can use tokens to track their accumulated Fear and as counters on adversary stat blocks. GAME CARDS Along with this rulebook, you’ll also need the cards that come with the core set: ancestry, community, subclass, and domain cards. If you don’t have a physical set of cards (or need extra copies), you can download and print the cards at home. The “Domain Card Reference” section in the appendix also contains the text for cards from the core set. CHARACTER SHEETS AND NOTES The appendix contains a general character sheet and the guides you can use to build your characters, but we recommend using the class-specific character sheets from www.daggerheart.com for the best experience. The remainder of this rulebook will assume you’re using the class-specific sheets. If you’re using pencil and paper, you’ll want to have these materials printed out. If you’re using a digital version instead, ensure you have a laptop or tablet available to view and edit your character sheet and guide during the game. We also recommend paper and writing utensils (or a digital equivalent) to record important details that the GM or other players share. OPTIONAL: MAPS AND MINIATURES You can use maps and miniatures to represent the scenarios the players are facing, especially during battle, to more fully illustrate the scene, rather than relying on only narration and description. When drawing or building a map, the scale, distance, and details won’t always be perfect, and that’s okay. The maps and the miniatures should never limit your imagination—only provide extra spatial context so everyone can picture the scene clearly. 8 Introduction"

BE A FAN OF YOUR CHARACTER AND THEIR JOURNEY Find ways to show off what your character does best and what they do worst. Strive to make interesting choices and learn more about who they are through play. Push your character’s story forward and let them grow with the fiction. SPOTLIGHT YOUR FRIENDS Look for opportunities to put other characters in the spotlight. Provide them openings to do what they do best, ask them for help and offer yours freely, and prompt them to share more of their thoughts and feelings. ADDRESS THE CHARACTERS AND ADDRESS THE PLAYERS Speak to the other characters within the world of the fiction. Lean on the connections you build together, ask them questions, and create a story using your conversations as well as your actions. Speak to the other players outside of the fiction. Ask them what their character might do and what they want to see happen in the narrative. As you play, be considerate of their preferences and desires. BUILD THE WORLD TOGETHER In Daggerheart, every participant is a storyteller, not just the GM. Daggerheart is a highly collaborative game and reaches its greatest potential when every player (including the GM) is working together. This means actively advocating for the story beats you want to see, offering suggestions to enrich the arcs of the other player characters, creating parts of the world with others at the table, and thinking deeply about your character’s motivations. PLAY TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS Everything you do at the table should flow from the fiction. Listen to your fellow players and the GM—then react to what their characters say and do to discover the story together as you build on each other’s creativity. If you roll the dice, let the results lead you through what happens next. Embrace complications with the same vigor with which you celebrate victories. HOLD ON GENTLY Improvisational storytelling isn’t always perfect, and that’s okay. Hold on gently to the fiction—enough that you don’t lose the pieces that matter, but not so tightly that the narrative has no room to breathe. Let yourself make mistakes and make changes. Smooth the edges and shape them to fit the story. Even if the story beats don't go the way you expect or a sudden twist catches you by surprise, trust that the GM and your fellow players will all create something beautiful and memorable by the end. Following these principles will help guide you in telling exciting, unpredictable, and meaningful stories together at your table. A Table for All Daggerheart is a game for players of all races, ethnicities, genders, faiths, sexualities, and identities. It is the responsibility of each player in the game to ensure that the table you share is a place where everyone is empowered, respected, and safe. Because of the nature of open-ended storytelling in roleplaying games, it’s possible to touch upon topics that might be difficult or sensitive for some players. Subject matter that might just be an imaginary scenario for you could bring up a real-life topic that is personal or uncomfortable for somebody else. When you gather to play for the first time, make sure that you talk through what kind of experience you’re all looking to have, and bring up any themes or topics you’d like to avoid. Everyone should abide by this social contract, and add to or modify it at any time as needed. The “Session Zero and Safety Tools” section in chapter 3 presents resources you can use to help navigate difficult scenarios together. 9 Introduction"

The upcoming sections describe Daggerheart’s worldbuilding fundamentals, then walk you through creating a character while providing information on each of the classes, domains, ancestries, and communities. World Overview Daggerheart encourages the exploration of worlds filled with great magic, wondrous landscapes, mythical beasts, dynamic factions, rousing mysteries, and powerful foes. While the world your table collaboratively creates will be your own, Daggerheart has established ancestries, communities, classes, abilities, and spells—so some worldbuiding aspects will exist similarly across every campaign. The following section describes the core realms, where these shared details derive from. These details can always be reflavored or modified to match the style of game your group wants to play. When creating your table’s unique world, you can use one of the following as a starting point: an existing location you’re already familiar with, a supplemental setting book, the guide for creating your own world in the “Running a Campaign” section in chapter 3, or a campaign frame from chapter 5. CORE REALMS The core realms are the basis for the worldbuilding elements inherent to many of Daggerheart’s mechanics, such as its ancestries and adversaries. THE MORTAL REALM Most adventures will likely take place in the Mortal Realm. This is the land, sea, and sky, where mortals live out the entirety of their lives—the plane where the majority of all material beings and objects exist. Stories say this realm was created by the Forgotten Gods during the Earliest Age and that these immortals traveled between the Hallows Above and this new plane as easily as waking from a dream. During this time, the gods were familiar to the mortals and acts of divinity were commonplace—be they wonderful or terrifying. When the Forgotten Gods were overthrown by the New Gods, many of these ancient deities were trapped within this plane eternally. This realm is also occupied by the Faint Divinities, lesser deities created by both the Forgotten and the New Gods to oversee the Mortal Realm. Many are considered to be quite capricious, and though their spheres of influence are smaller than the gods who created them, they can greatly influence the lives of mortals. THE HALLOWS ABOVE The Hallows Above are the collection of deific territories that once belonged to the Forgotten Gods before the New Gods claimed it at the end of the Earliest Age. Because this place is closely connected with most other realms, the gods residing here can see and speak with the creatures of the Mortal Realm without leaving their domain, though those with whom the gods communicate may find their methods strange or obfuscated. There are ways by which the New Gods can leave the Hallows Above to occupy other realms, but in the current age they must always sacrifice something of personal importance to do so. It’s rumored that this burden was necessitated by their desire to protect the Hallows from the Forgotten Gods should they rise again, as the Forgotten Gods (or any being from the Mortal Realm) would also have to forfeit much to enter the Hallows Above. These sacrifices have caused some of the great calamities that have befallen the Mortal Realm in recent millenia. THE CIRCLES BELOW The Circles Below are the collection of lower realms where many of the Forgotten Gods, those who fought the most passionately during the uprising, were banished. Known as “the Fallen Gods,” these deities lost the Divine War with the New Gods during the Earliest Age and have since been deemed “evil practitioners of tainted magic.” Thus the Faint Divinities who were banished alongside them are commonly referred to as “demons,” and those that descended from these creatures also bear the weight of that identifier. The Circles Below are considered places of corruption, destruction, and violence. Stories say this dominion is home to some of the most dangerous creatures in the core realms. Most other planes have safeguards against Fallen who wish to cross from the Circles Below. Within the Mortal Realm, the use of arcane magic in acts of great evil is said to open a temporary rift between the two planes, allowing Fallen to pass through. THE REALMS BEYOND The cosmos holds many realms beyond these—the Elemental Lands, the Astral Realm, the Valley of Death, and countless others. Accessing and traversing these places from the Mortal Realm requires specialized knowledge and hard-learned skills. Still, some of the beings in the core realms guard these secrets closely and could be persuaded to share them—for a price. 11 Chapter 1: Preparing for Adventure"

Magic in Daggerheart is both very powerful and incredibly dangerous, permeating the land and manifesting within the people. It is both a force within you that can aid you throughout your journey and a force outside of you that affects the world. If your character does have the power of spellcasting, you’ll use magic through specific weapons, spells, and other means. As characters grow, the magic they can perform grows with them. Each level, you gain cards that describe the new, powerful magic they can wield and the specific parameters for using it. FLAVORING YOUR GAME If the default portrayal of your character’s mechanical effects doesn’t fit them and their style, you can always describe them in a way that does. This is often called “flavoring.” However, unless your table agrees, that flavor shouldn’t offer any mechanical effect beyond the effect’s existing description. For instance, you might say that your rogue’s magic takes the form of gadgets and inventions, instead of magically creating a dark cloud, they drop a smoke grenade. Or perhaps your ranger’s magic takes the form of ancestral spirits who draw forth the forces of nature. Perhaps magic works in an entirely different way in your lore, and you explain how every class’s power emerges from a different source. As long as it abides by the mechanics of the game, you’re encouraged to flavor your magic to suit your character. You can reflavor items, as well. Your character might have a unique weapon from their heritage, but it uses the statistics of a longsword. Your wizard’s armor might come in the form of a set of empowered runes instead of chainmail, but they still have Armor Slots you can spend to reduce damage. In this case, “repairing” your armor during a rest could mean replenishing the enchantment. The “Adjusting Abilities and Spells” section of this chapter suggests other ways you can tailor your spells and abilities to fit your character and comfort level. 12 Chapter 1: World Overview"

In addition to choosing their class, community, and ancestry, you’re also responsible for crafting their physical appearance, personality, and prior experience, as well as their relationships with the other characters. Some of these decisions are purely narrative, meaning they only appear in the game through your roleplaying, but others are mechanical choices that affect the actions you’re more (or less) likely to succeed at when rolling your dice. GETTING STARTED Before you create your character, discuss the campaign with your table and begin brainstorming ideas. Tip: There are many mechanics mentioned in the Character Creation section that will be fully covered in chapter 2. HAVE A SESSION ZERO If you’re preparing to start a new campaign with your group, we recommend that you use your first session together to build characters and talk about the world you’ll be playing in. This is often called a session zero (see the “Session Zero and Safety Tools” section on page 169) and is the best way to ensure that everyone is on the same page about the tone and feel of the campaign so you can create characters who work well together. THINK ABOUT CHARACTER CONCEPTS Before you begin the character-building process, it can be helpful to review the materials and formulate an idea for what type of character you want to play. Your concept can be surface-level and general—such as “a circus performer who uses magic” or “a captain who lost their ship at sea”—but having even a basic starting point will help you make choices as you move through each of the following step. STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR CLASS The first step of character creation is to choose the class you want to play. Each class is a role-based archetype that determines what abilities you have access to throughout the campaign. For example, you might choose to play a guardian if you want to be the “tank” of your group who runs into fights headfirst and protects others with their own life. You might choose to be a wizard if you want to cast unique spells to solve problems, heal party members, and wield cunning battle magic. Once you’ve chosen a class, you’ll also choose a subclass. The subclasses are subsets of each class that further define your character’s archetype. 13 Chapter 1: Character Creation"

The character sheet is for recording your character’s details, so make sure you have paper or digital copies available. If you’re filling out a hard copy, use a pencil, as you’ll change details on the sheet as your character levels up. You can find a completed character sheet in the upcoming “Example Character” section. Customized character sheets and character guides are available for download at www.daggerheart.com. A general character sheet is also available in the appendix. RECORD YOUR LEVEL Characters in Daggerheart start at level 1. Record your level in the appropriate section at the top of your character sheet, and make sure to change it every time you level up. We recommend starting your campaign at level 1, but a more experienced table can start at a higher level if the GM and players prefer. RECORD CHARACTER DETAILS At any point in the character creation process, feel free to fill out your character’s name and pronouns on the top line, as well as the Character Description details on the character guide. For some people, their character’s name and appearance come first, and for others, it takes time to discover what’s right. As long as you have a name and description by the time your table is finished with character creation, it doesn’t matter what order you complete these steps in. CLASS FEATURE Every class begins with a unique class feature (or several). You don’t have to write these features down—they’re provided at the bottom left of each class’s character sheet. These are features available only to your class. If your class feature asks you to make a selection during character creation, make it before your first session. STEP 2: CHOOSE YOUR HERITAGE Next, choose your character’s heritage. This aspect of your character includes two elements—their ancestry and their community. CHOOSE YOUR ANCESTRY A character’s ancestry reflects their lineage, impacting their physicality and granting them two unique features. Take the card for one of the following ancestries, then write its name in the Heritage field of your character sheet: Clank Firbolg Human Drakona Fungril Infernis Dwarf Galapa Katari Elf Giant Orc Faerie Goblin Ribbet Faun Halfling Simiah You can learn more about these ancestries in the upcoming “Ancestry” section. CHOOSE YOUR COMMUNITY Next, you’ll choose a community from the available community cards. Your character’s community is influenced by its physical location, values, and goals. It informs the culture your character grew up in and might play a part in the way they look, act, or approach situations. Each community comes with a feature that you can utilize during the game. Take the card for one of the following communities, then write its name in the Heritage field of your character sheet: Highborne Ridgeborne Underborne Loreborne Seaborne Wanderborne Orderborne Slyborne Wildborne You can learn more about these communities in the upcoming “Community” section. LANGUAGES In Daggerheart, you’re not asked to pick specific languages for your character. This game assumes that everyone speaks a common language (it’s up to you whether that’s through mundane or magical means) and that sign language is widely understood across cultures and communities. If you’d like to have specific regional languages in your campaign, discuss options with your table. 16 Chapter 1: Character Creation"

These values reflect your natural or trained ability in each of the core six stats: Agility, Strength, Finesse, Instinct, Presence, and Knowledge. Each trait lists verbs (such as Sprint, Leap, and Maneuver) that show the types of actions a character might perform that involve that trait. These examples are just inspiration—they shouldn’t limit how each trait can be used. AGILITY: Sprint, Leap, Maneuver A high Agility means you’re fast on your feet, nimble on difficult terrain, and quick to react to danger. You’ll make an Agility Roll to scurry up a rope, sprint to cover, or bound from rooftop to rooftop. STRENGTH: Lift, Smash, Grapple A high Strength means you’re better at feats that test your physical prowess and stamina. You’ll make a Strength Roll to break through a door, lift heavy objects, or hold your ground against a charging foe. FINESSE: Control, Hide, Tinker A high Finesse means you’re skilled at tasks that require accuracy, stealth, or the utmost control. You’ll make a Finesse Roll to use fine tools, escape notice, or strike with precision. INSTINCT: Perceive, Sense, Navigate A high Instinct means you have a keen sense of your surroundings and a natural intuition. You’ll make an Instinct Roll to sense danger, notice details in the world around you, or track an elusive foe. PRESENCE: Charm, Perform, Deceive A high Presence means you have a strong force of personality and a facility for social situations. You’ll make a Presence Roll to plead your case, intimidate a foe, or capture the attention of a crowd. KNOWLEDGE: Recall, Analyze, Comprehend A high Knowledge means you know information others don’t and understand how to apply your mind through deduction and inference. You’ll make a Knowledge Roll to interpret facts, see the patterns clearly, or remember important information. DISTRIBUTE TRAIT MODIFIERS Trait modifiers are the values associated with each trait. When you make an action roll using one of these traits, that trait’s modifier is added to the roll to determine the final result (or subtracted from the roll for a negative modifier). Distribute the following starting modifiers across your character’s traits in any order you wish: +2, +1, +1, 0, 0, −1. When distributing these modifiers, consider what actions you want your character to be good at, what weapon you want to use for your attacks, and what kind of spellcasting you’ll be doing, if any. Weapons and spells are covered in future sections, but the character guide for your class offers suggested placement for your modifiers if you want a starting point. You can also rearrange your modifiers as needed during character creation, as well as after your first few sessions of play. If you ever need to refer to your trait modifiers as values (if a card or effect references your Agility, Presence, etc.) a +2 would be considered 2, and a −1 would still be considered −1. For example, if a domain card tells you to place a number of tokens equal to your character’s Knowledge on that card, and their Knowledge is +3, you would place 3 tokens on the card. If they have a negative modifier in that trait, you instead would place no tokens on the card (unless otherwise noted). 17 Chapter 1: Character Creation"

EVASION Your character’s Evasion reflects how hard it is for adversaries to hit them. Your class’s starting Evasion appears right beneath the Evasion field on your character sheet; copy this number into the Evasion field. When an adversary makes an attack against your character, the GM rolls against their Evasion to see if the adversary succeeds. You can choose how your character’s Evasion manifests within the narrative—a wizard might avoid blows with shimmering arcane shields or bat away an adversary’s spells, while a ranger nimbly dodges out of the way of attacks and a warrior parries, blocks, and dodges. Your character’s Evasion starts low, but that’s because it’s not their only means of avoiding damage. If they’re hit, you’ll also have the opportunity to reduce the incoming damage using armor. HIT POINTS AND STRESS Your character’s health and well-being are represented by Hit Points and Stress. Hit Points (sometimes called HP) are an abstract reflection of your physical fortitude and ability to take hits from both blade and magic. Each class starts with a set number of Hit Points. Stress reflects your ability to withstand the pressures of dangerous situations and mental strain. Every class starts with 6 Stress. You can describe your character’s Hit Points and Stress any way you wish, but they generally represent your character’s ability to get knocked down and keep coming back. You’ll mark your character’s Hit Points and Stress when these situations arise—and the fewer marks you have, the better. HOPE AND FEAR Hope and Fear are currencies used by the players and the GM to represent the way fate turns for or against the characters during the game. You start with 2 Hope; mark these in the Hope field of your character sheet. Any time you roll with Hope on your Duality Dice—meaning your Hope Die rolled higher than your Fear Die—you gain a Hope (to a maximum of 6). During the game, you can spend Hope to help your character’s allies, apply their life experiences to challenges, and empower their spells and abilities. If you instead roll with Fear on your Duality Dice—meaning your Fear Die rolled higher than your Hope Die—the GM gains a Fear that they can spend on certain effects. Sometimes a Fear roll introduces other complications into a scene (even if you succeed on your roll). STEP 5: CHOOSE YOUR STARTING EQUIPMENT Next, you’ll choose starting weapons, armor, and other items for your character. CHOOSE YOUR WEAPONS You use physical weapons to attack your foes—and if you have a Spellcast trait (such as from your subclass), you can also wield magic weapons. At character creation, you can choose either a two-handed primary weapon, or a one-handed primary weapon and a one-handed secondary weapon, then equip them. You can find weapon suggestions at the top of your character guide, but if you’d like to choose your own, you can find all starting (Tier 1) weapons in the “Primary Weapon Tables” and “Secondary Weapon Tables” sections in chapter 2. (These are also available as a separate sheet to print out from the Daggerheart website or in the appendix.) At Level 1, your Proficiency is 1. This means you’ll roll one damage die for your weapon attacks. In the Active Weapons area of your character sheet, this is recorded in the Proficiency field. Tip: In the area of your character labeled Damage Dice & Type, record your damage dice with the Proficiency value already written in (like “1d6+3” instead of “d6+3”), to remind yourself how many weapon dice to roll. Whenever you increase your Proficiency, you also increase the number of dice in the damage dice field to reflect this change. For example, when your Proficiency becomes 2, you would change it to \"2d6+3\" instead. CHOOSE YOUR ARMOR You use armor to reduce the severity of incoming attacks. At character creation, you can choose one set of armor and equip it. You can find armor suggestions at the top of your character guide, but if you’d like to choose your own, you can find all starting (Tier 1) armor in the “Armor Tables” section in chapter 2. (These are also available as a separate sheet to print out from the Daggerheart website or in the appendix.) When your character equips armor, record its details in the Active Armor fields of your character sheet. An armor’s damage thresholds (shown in the “Base Thresholds” column) indicate how much damage a character can endure before marking Hit Points. Add your character’s level to both values and record the total for both numbers in the corresponding fields. In the “Hit Points and Damage Thresholds” section of chapter 2, you’ll learn how many Hit Points to mark on your character sheet each time your character takes damage. 18 Chapter 1: Character Creation"

This score includes the armor’s base value (shown in the “Base Score” column) plus any permanent bonuses your character has to their Armor Score from other abilities. When your character takes damage, you can mark one of the small shield symbols next to your Armor Score (called an Armor Slot), then reduce the severity of the damage by one threshold: Severe to Major, Major to Minor, or Minor to None. You can only mark one Armor Slot per attack, and you have a number of slots equal to your Armor Score. CHOOSE OTHER STARTING ITEMS Your inventory includes anything else your character is carrying. The top of your character guide lists all their starting inventory items, which include the following: • Torch (useful for illuminating a dark room) • 50 feet of rope (useful for climbing a wall or rappelling down a cliff) • Basic supplies (tent, bedroll, tinderbox, rations, etc.) • A handful of gold (record this in the Gold field in the left-hand column of your character sheet) • Your choice of a Minor Health Potion (clear 1d4 Hit Points) or a Minor Stamina Potion (clear 1d4 Stress) • The “and either” option on your character guide is specific to your class. You might also be asked to choose what you use to carry your spells. Record these items in the Inventory fields of your character sheet. This equipment is available to use during the party’s adventures in any way that fits the shared story. We encourage you to use items creatively, as long as the GM agrees and it fits the rules of the world. You can also talk to your GM about other items you’d like to have at the start of the game. There are no rules limiting the size of your inventory, so items that don’t provide a mechanical benefit but make sense for your character to have are normally okay—but your GM always makes the final call. STEP 6: CREATE YOUR BACKGROUND Next, explore your character’s background by answering the background questions in your character guide. Several prompts are provided to jumpstart inspiration, but you or the GM can modify or replace these questions to fit the character you’re looking to play. The prompts are a jumping-off point if you don’t know where to start, but they should never inhibit your creativity. The decisions you make about your character’s background are purely narrative, but they deeply impact the character you’re playing and the story the GM is preparing for your adventures. Over the course of character creation, feel free to adjust mechanical choices you made in earlier steps to better reflect this background as you shape your character. If you’re planning to play in a campaign, you can continue developing your character after the background questions in whatever way works best for you. Just remember to give the GM your backstory so they can work any people, places, or ideas from it into the campaign. You can also choose not to do any more background work, instead finding out more about your character as you play. Lean into a process that’s fun for you. 19 Chapter 1: Character Creation"

An Experience is a word or phrase used to encapsulate a specific set of skills your character has acquired over the course of their exciting life. Your character starts with two Experiences at character creation (each with a +2 modifier), and they’ll earn more throughout your adventures. Before creating Experiences, you’ll want to have a solid idea of who your character is; the background questions are especially helpful for this. When you’re ready, work with your GM to create two Experiences that have shaped your character. There’s no set list of Experiences to choose from (though we offer options for inspiration under “Experience Examples”). Instead, find a word or phrase that embodies something distinctive about your character. Each Experience should be specific. For example, Talented or Focused are too broad, as they can be applied to almost any situation; instead you might use Swashbuckler or Magic Studies. Additionally, your character’s Experience can’t give them spells or specific game abilities. For example, Take Flight or One-Hit Kill are too mechanically oriented; you might consider Pilot or Assassin instead. You are also encouraged to add flavor to your character’s Experience to give it more varied use in play. For example, instead of just Assassin, you could choose Assassin of the Sapphire Syndicate. Details like this give your GM an exciting faction to weave into the campaign, and also make it easier to use this Experience outside combat. For example, if your character encounters an ally of the syndicate, they might be particularly adept at negotiating with that NPC based on their Experience. Once you’ve decided on your character’s two starting Experiences, record them in the Experience fields of your character sheet and assign +2 to both. Tip: If you’re not sure what Experiences to take, consider the style of the campaign you’re playing in and the actions you’ll want to perform. In a standard, battle-focused campaign, it’s never a bad idea to take your character’s first Experience in something that will help with combat and the second Experience in something useful outside of combat. EXPERIENCE EXAMPLES Backgrounds: Assassin, Blacksmith, Bodyguard, Bounty Hunter, Chef to the Royal Family, Circus Performer, Con Artist, Fallen Monarch, Field Medic, High Priestess, Merchant, Noble, Pirate, Politician, Runaway, Scholar, Sellsword, Soldier, Storyteller, Thief, World Traveler Characteristics: Affable, Battle-Hardened, Bookworm, Charming, Cowardly, Friend to All, Helpful, Intimidating Presence, Leader, Lone Wolf, Loyal, Observant, Prankster, Silver Tongue, Sticky Fingers, Stubborn to a Fault, Survivor, Young and Naive Specialties: Acrobat, Gambler, Healer, Inventor, Magical Historian, Mapmaker, Master of Disguise, Navigator, Sharpshooter, Survivalist, Swashbuckler, Tactician Skills: Animal Whisperer, Barter, Deadly Aim, Fast Learner, Incredible Strength, Liar, Light Feet, Negotiator, Photographic Memory, Quick Hands, Repair, Scavenger, Tracker Phrases: Catch Me If You Can, Fake It Till You Make It, First Time’s the Charm, Hold the Line, I Won’t Let You Down, I’ll Catch You, I’ve Got Your Back, Knowledge Is Power, Nature’s Friend, Never Again, No One Left Behind, Pick on Someone Your Own Size, The Show Must Go On, This Is Not a Negotiation, Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing USING EXPERIENCES When one of your character’s Experiences fits the situation at hand, you can use that Experience to showcase their expertise. Before you make an action or reaction roll, you can spend a Hope to add the Experience’s modifier to the roll’s result. Sometimes more than one of your character’s Experiences is a good fit for the situation (for example, if your character is trying to sneak past a guard in the dark, your I Live in the Shadows and Stealthy Experiences would both apply). If it fits the story, you can add more than one experience modifier to a roll, spending a Hope for each. CHANGING EXPERIENCES Your character has the opportunity to gain new Experiences as they gain levels. However, if you discover that your character has outgrown a previous Experience or it doesn’t feel right anymore, you’re not stuck with the ones you’ve already chosen. For example, you might find that your character’s Stealthy Experience no longer matches the head-on way they’ve learned to solve problems. Or perhaps your group likes to try to solve things diplomatically first, so your character’s Catch Them by Surprise Experience isn’t a good fit for the table’s collaborative story. That’s totally okay! Work with your GM to find Experiences that better align with your storytelling goals, and with the actions your character would be good at. 20 Chapter 1: Character Creation"

The following domains are included in this book: Arcana, Blade, Bone, Codex, Grace, Midnight, Sage, Splendor, and Valor. Each domain has a domain deck—a deck of cards containing abilities and spells with a central theme or focus. For details on what each domain represents and how to use your domain cards, see the upcoming “Domains” section. Each class in Daggerheart is formed by combining two of these domains—for example, the warrior class comprises Blade and Bone, the druid comprises Arcana and Sage, and the rogue comprises Midnight and Grace. This combination is noted at the top of the character sheet for each class, and the colors and symbols are found on the subclass foundation card. To start, look at all the level 1 cards from your class’s two domains and choose two cards, returning the rest to their respective decks. You can take one from each domain or two from a single domain, whichever you prefer. These cards grant you special spells and abilities; you’ll choose another card each time you level up. Tip: All domain card text can also be found for reference on page 328. SHARED DOMAINS Each class shares its domains with at least one other class. For example, Blade is shared by the guardian and the warrior, Sage is shared by the druid and the ranger, and Grace is shared by the bard and the rogue. If a fellow player’s class has the same domain as yours, we encourage you to coordinate with them and choose different cards from that domain deck (even if your group has multiple copies). This way, each player feels distinct and shines when they bring their unique abilities to the story. However, if the GM and players agree, feel free to make an exception. Sharing cards is common when more than one player chooses the same class or when three (or more) players share the same domain. As always, it comes down to open communication between the players and the GM. If you need extra copies of a card, you can download and print them at home. STEP 9: CREATE YOUR CONNECTIONS You’ve almost finished creating your character! Now it’s time to forge their connections. These represent the relationships and personal history between your character and their fellow party members. Once your group is comfortable with their finished (or almost- finished) PCs, summarize your characters for each other. At minimum, share their name, pronouns, character description, Experiences, and the answers to the background questions— but feel free to include any details you’d like the other players to know. Then work together to decide how your characters are connected and how they feel about each other. The Connections section of your character guide provides inspiration—we recommend you pick at least one question to ask another player for their character to answer—but you’re welcome to create new questions. You can always turn down a question or relationship suggested by another player if it’s not a good fit or not a relationship you’re interested in exploring. While it’s great to create connections with every character, it’s perfectly okay if you’re not sure about some of them yet—and you can always discover your relationships through play. These connections are a starting point to build on during the game. After the party’s connections are complete, you’re ready to play!

I tried to harness raw magic before I knew what I was doing and I destroyed a farm, ruining the harvest for that year. After that, I was treated as an outcast. Barnacle - He trusts me because I am the closest thing he’s ever had to a mother. Yarrow, a great mage who served on behalf of King Emeris, heard of the destruction I caused and sought me out. He taught me to harness magic. When he died, I became the right hand to the king instead. I miss him. Varian - They had a falling out with the king and are worried I might side with Emeris over them if it comes down to it. On his deathbed, Yarrow said I was the only person who could keep King Emeris safe from the Harrows. I don’t know what they are, and everytime I’ve brought it up with the King, he refuses to tell me. I am afraid that in protecting me, he is dooming himself. Garrick - The king does not allow his inner circle to have personal relationships with anybody for fear they could compromise our work. We broke that rule many, many times. Tip: Use the Sidecar sheet (available in the appendix or at www.daggerheart.com/downloads) to help you find different sections on the character sheet.

The combination of two domains forms the basis for each class’s abilities and spells, which you gain from your domain cards. Near the end of character creation, you’ll pick your first cards from your chosen class’s domains. Arcana Arcana is the domain of innate and instinctual magic. Those who choose this path tap into the raw, enigmatic forces of the realms to manipulate both their own energy and the elements. Arcana offers wielders a volatile power, but it is incredibly potent when correctly channeled. Blade Blade is the domain of weapon mastery. Whether by steel, bow, or perhaps a more specialized arm, those who follow this path have the skill to cut short the lives of others. Wielders of Blade dedicate themselves to achieving inexorable power over death. Bone Bone is the domain of tactics and the body. Practitioners of this domain have an uncanny control over their own physical abilities and an eye for predicting the behaviors of others in combat. Adherents to Bone gain an unparalleled understanding of bodies and their movements. Codex Codex is the domain of intensive magical study. Those who seek magical knowledge turn to the equations of power recorded in books, written on scrolls, etched into walls, or tattooed on bodies. Codex offers a commanding and versatile understanding of magic to devotees who pursue knowledge beyond the boundaries of common wisdom. Grace Grace is the domain of charisma. Through rapturous storytelling, charming spells, or a shroud of lies, those who channel this power define the realities of their adversaries, bending perception to their will. Grace offers its wielders raw magnetism and mastery over language. Midnight Midnight is the domain of shadows and secrecy. Whether by clever tricks, deft magic, or the cloak of night, those who channel these forces practice the art of obscurity and can uncover sequestered treasures. Midnight offers practitioners the power to control and create enigmas. Sage Sage is the domain of the natural world. Those who walk this path tap into the unfettered power of the earth and its creatures to unleash raw magic. Sage grants its adherents the vitality of a blooming flower and the ferocity of a ravenous predator. Splendor Splendor is the domain of life. Through this magic, followers gain the ability to heal and, to an extent, control death. Splendor offers its disciples the magnificent ability to both give and end life. Valor Valor is the domain of protection. Whether through attack or defense, those who choose this discipline channel formidable strength to protect their allies in battle. Valor offers great power to those who raise their shields in defense of others. 24 Chapter 1: Domains"

Some domain cards provide moves you can make, such as a unique attack or a spell. Others offer passive effects (which always apply while you hold that card), new abilities to use during downtime or social encounters, or even one-time benefits. Each domain card includes five elements: 1. Level: The number in the top left of the card indicates the card’s level. You can only choose domain cards of your level or lower. 2. Domain: Beneath the card’s level there is a symbol indicating its domain. You can only choose cards from your class’s domains. 3. Recall Cost: The number and lightning bolt in the top right of the card shows its Recall Cost. This doesn’t affect you at character creation, but once you reach level 5, you’ll have more cards than space in your loadout (your set of five active cards; see the “Loadout and Vault” section on page 101). You can normally only move an inactive card from your vault to your loadout during downtime, but you can mark a number of Stress equal to a card’s Recall Cost to swap it immediately. 4. Type: The card’s type is listed in the center above the title. There are three types of domain cards: abilities, spells, and grimoires. Abilities are typically mundane in nature, while spells are magical. Grimoires are unique to the Codex domain and are a collection of smaller spells bundled together. Some game mechanics only apply to certain types of cards. 5. Feature: The text on the bottom half of the card describes its feature, including any special rules you need to follow when you use that card. 1 4 5 3 2 26 Chapter 1: Domains"

Your chosen class grants the following: Domains: Each class lists the two domains that serve as the basis for its abilities. You can choose cards from these domain decks during character creation and when leveling up. Starting Evasion: Each class has its own starting Evasion. Starting Hit Points: Each class has its own amount of starting Hit Points. Class Items: Each class has a unique set of starter items. Class Feature: Each class has a unique class feature (or set of features). Class Hope Feature: Each class has a special move they can make by spending 3 Hope. Your chosen subclass grants the following: Spellcast Trait: If you’re a spellcaster, this is the character trait your subclass uses any time you make a Spellcast Roll. Foundation Feature: The foundation feature is the unique starting feature that establishes the identity and strengths of the subclass. Specialization Feature: The specialization feature is a more advanced feature (or set of features) you can gain when you level up. For some subclasses, the specialization feature is a new ability; for others, it expands the abilities of the class or foundation feature, making it even more potent. Mastery Feature: The mastery feature is your subclass’s most powerful feature, which you can gain at higher levels. For some subclasses, the mastery feature unlocks an extraordinary new ability; for others, it’s the impressive culmination of their subclass’s core feature. The foundation, specialization, and mastery features each come with a card that you can choose to take as one of the benefits from leveling up. The cards hold information about the feature for quick reference. The following class sections refer to many mechanics and terms that will be taught throughout chapter 2.

Members of this class are masters of captivation and specialize in a variety of performance types, including singing, playing musical instruments, weaving tales, or telling jokes. Whether performing for an audience or speaking to an individual, bards thrive in social situations. Members of this profession bond and train at schools or guilds, but a current of egotism runs through those of the bardic persuasion. While they may be the most likely class to bring people together, a bard of ill temper can just as easily tear a party apart. DOMAINS Grace and Codex STARTING EVASION SCORE 10 STARTING HIT POINTS 5 CLASS ITEMS A romance novel or a letter never opened BARD’S HOPE FEATURE Make a Scene: Spend 3 Hope to temporarily Distract a target within Close range, giving them a -2 penalty to their Difficulty. CLASS FEATURE Rally Once per session, describe how you rally the party and give yourself and each of your allies a Rally Die. At level 1, your Rally Die is a d6. A PC can spend their Rally Die to roll it, adding the result to their action roll, reaction roll, damage roll, or to clear a number of Stress equal to the result. At the end of each session, clear all unspent Rally Dice. At level 5, your Rally Die increases to a d8. BARD SUBCLASSES Choose either the Troubadour or Wordsmith subclass. TROUBADOUR Play the Troubadour if you want to play music to bolster your allies. SPELLCAST TRAIT Presence FOUNDATION FEATURE Gifted Performer: Describe how you perform for others. You can play each song once per long rest: • Relaxing Song: You and all allies within Close range clear a Hit Point. • Epic Song: Make a target within Close range temporarily Vulnerable. • Heartbreaking Song: You and all allies within Close range gain a Hope. SPECIALIZATION FEATURE Maestro: Your rallying songs steel the courage of those who listen. When you give a Rally Die to an ally, they can gain a Hope or clear a Stress.

Heart of a Poet: After you make an action roll to impress, persuade, or offend someone, you can spend a Hope to add a d4 to the roll. SPECIALIZATION FEATURE Eloquent: Your moving words boost morale. Once per session, when you encourage an ally, you can do one of the following: • Allow them to find a mundane object or tool they need. • Help an Ally without spending Hope. • Give them an additional downtime move during their next rest. MASTERY FEATURE Epic Poetry: Your Rally Die increases to a d10. Additionally, when you Help an Ally, you can narrate the moment as if you were writing the tale of their heroism in a memoir. When you do, roll a d10 as your advantage die. BACKGROUND QUESTIONS Answer any of the following background questions.

While one might underestimate a gentle druid who practices the often-quiet work of cultivating flora, druids who channel the untamed forces of nature are terrifying to behold. Druids cultivate their abilities in small groups, often connected by a specific ethos or locale, but some choose to work alone. Through years of study and dedication, druids can learn to transform into beasts and shape nature itself. DOMAINS Sage and Arcana STARTING EVASION 10 STARTING HIT POINTS 6 CLASS ITEMS A small bag of rocks and bones or a strange pendant found in the dirt DRUID’S HOPE FEATURE Evolution: Spend 3 Hope to transform into a Beastform without marking a Stress. When you do, choose one trait to raise by +1 until you drop out of that Beastform. CLASS FEATURES Beastform Mark a Stress to magically transform into a creature of your tier or lower from the Beastform list. You can drop out of this form at any time. While transformed, you can’t use weapons or cast spells from domain cards, but you can still use other features or abilities you have access to. Spells you cast before you transform stay active and last for their normal duration, and you can talk and communicate as normal. Additionally, you gain the Beastform’s features, add their Evasion bonus to your Evasion, and use the trait specified in their statistics for your attack. While you’re in a Beastform, your armor becomes part of your body and you mark Armor Slots as usual; when you drop out of a Beastform, those marked Armor Slots remain marked. If you mark your last Hit Point, you automatically drop out of this form. Wildtouch You can perform harmless, subtle effects that involve nature—such as causing a flower to rapidly grow, summoning a slight gust of wind, or starting a campfire—at will. DRUID SUBCLASSES Choose either the Warden of the Elements or Warden of Renewal subclass. WARDEN OF THE ELEMENTS Play the Warden of the Elements if you want to embody the natural elements of the wild. SPELLCAST TRAIT Instinct FOUNDATION FEATURE Elemental Incarnation: Mark a Stress to Channel one of the following elements until you take Severe damage or until your next rest: • Fire: When an adversary within Melee range deals damage to you, they take 1d10 magic damage. • Earth: Gain a bonus to your damage thresholds equal to your Proficiency. • Water: When you deal damage to an adversary within Melee range, all other adversaries within Very Close range must mark a Stress. • Air: You can hover, gaining advantage on Agility Rolls. SPECIALIZATION FEATURE Elemental Aura: Once per rest while Channeling, you can assume an aura matching your element. The aura affects targets within Close range until your Channeling ends. • Fire: When an adversary marks 1 or more Hit Points, they must also mark a Stress. • Earth: Your allies gain a +1 bonus to Strength. • Water: When an adversary deals damage to you, you can mark a Stress to move them anywhere within Very Close range of where they are. • Air: When you or an ally takes damage from an attack beyond Melee range, reduce the damage by 1d8. MASTERY FEATURE Elemental Dominion: You further embody your element. While Channeling, you gain the following benefit: • Fire: You gain a +1 bonus to your Proficiency for attacks and spells that deal damage. • Earth: When you would mark Hit Points, roll a d6 per Hit Point marked. For each result of 6, reduce the number of Hit Points you mark by 1. • Water: When an attack against you succeeds, you can mark a Stress to make the attacker temporarily Vulnerable. • Air: You gain a +1 bonus to your Evasion and can fly. 30 Chapter 1: Class"

When you spend a few minutes resting within the space, clear Stress equal to your Instinct, distributed as you choose between you and your allies. Regeneration: Touch a creature and spend 3 Hope. That creature clears 1d4 Hit Points. SPECIALIZATION FEATURES Regenerative Reach: You can target creatures within Very Close range with your “Regeneration” feature.

When you’re in Beastform and an ally within Close range marks 2 or more Hit Points, you can mark a Stress to reduce the number of Hit Points they mark by 1.

At the GM’s discretion, you can describe yourself transforming into any animal that reasonably fits into that category. Beastform categories are divided by tier. Each entry includes the following details: • Creature Category: Each category’s name describes the common role or behavior of creatures in that category (such as Agile Scout). This name is followed by a few examples of animals that fit in that category (in this example, fox, mouse, and weasel). • Character Trait: While transformed, you gain a bonus to the listed trait. For example, while transformed into an Agile Scout, you gain a +1 bonus to your Agility. When this form drops, you lose this bonus. • Attack Rolls: When you make an attack while transformed, you use the creature’s listed range, trait, and damage dice, but you use your Proficiency. For example, as an Agile Scout, you can attack a target within Melee range using your Agility. On a success, you deal d4 physical damage using your Proficiency. • Evasion: While transformed, you add the creature’s Evasion bonus to your normal Evasion. For example, if your Evasion is usually 8 and your Beastform says “Evasion +2,” your Evasion becomes 10 while you’re in that form. • Advantages: Your form makes you especially suited to certain actions. When you make an action or reaction roll related to one of the verbs listed for that creature category, you gain advantage on that roll. For example, an Agile Scout gains advantage on rolls made to sneak around, search for objects or creatures, and related activities. • Features: Each form includes unique features. For example, an Agile Scout excels at silent, dextrous movement—but they’re also fragile, making you more likely to drop out of Beastform. TIER 1 AGILE SCOUT (Fox, Mouse, Weasel, etc.) Agility +1 | Evasion +2 Melee Agility d4 phy Gain advantage on: deceive, locate, sneak Agile: Your movement is silent, and you can spend a Hope to move up to Far range without rolling.

GUARDIAN The title of guardian represents an array of martial professions, speaking more to their moral compass and unshakeable fortitude than the means by which they fight. While many guardians join groups of militants for either a country or cause, they’re more likely to follow those few they truly care for, majority be damned. Guardians are known for fighting with remarkable ferocity even against overwhelming odds, defending their cohort above all else.

RANGER Rangers are highly skilled hunters who, despite their martial abilities, rarely lend their skills to an army. Through mastery of the body and a deep understanding of the wilderness, rangers become sly tacticians, pursuing their quarry with cunning and patience. Many rangers track and fight alongside an animal companion with whom they’ve forged a powerful spiritual bond. By honing their skills in the wild, rangers become expert trackers, as likely to ensnare their foes in a trap as they are to assail them head-on.

This sheet is for tracking important information about your character’s companion and can be tucked beneath the right side of your character sheet for ease of viewing. STEP 1: NAME YOUR COMPANION Work with the GM to decide what kind of animal you have as your companion. Give them a name and add a picture of them to the companion sheet. STEP 2: WRITE THEIR EVASION Fill in their Evasion, which starts at 10. STEP 3: CHOOSE THEIR COMPANION EXPERIENCE Create two Experiences for your companion based on their training and the history you have together. Start with +2 in both Experiences. Whenever you gain a new Experience, your companion also gains one. All new Experiences start at +2. Example Companion Experiences Bold Distraction, Expert Climber, Fetch, Friendly, Guardian of the Forest, Horrifying, Intimidating, Loyal Until the End, Navigation, Nimble, Nobody Left Behind, On High Alert, Protective, Royal Companion, Scout, Service Animal, Trusted Mount, Vigilant, We Always Find Them, You Can’t Hit What You Can’t Find STEP 4: CHOOSE THEIR ATTACK AND RECORD DAMAGE DIE Finally, describe your companion’s method of dealing damage (their standard attack) and record it in the “Attack & Damage” section. At level 1, your companion’s damage die is a d6 and their range is Melee. WORKING WITH YOUR COMPANION The following sections will run you through the basics of working with your companion. USING SPELLCAST ROLLS, HOPE, AND EXPERIENCES Make a Spellcast Roll to connect with your companion and command them to take action. Spend a Hope to add an applicable Companion Experience to the roll. On a success with Hope, if your next action builds on their success, you gain advantage on the roll. ATTACKING WITH YOUR COMPANION When you command your companion to attack, they gain any benefits that would normally only apply to you (such as the effects of “Ranger’s Focus”). On a success, their damage roll uses your Proficiency and their damage die. TAKING DAMAGE AS STRESS When your companion would take any amount of damage, they mark a Stress. When they mark their last Stress, they drop out of the scene (by hiding, fleeing, or a similar action). They remain unavailable until the start of your next long rest, where they return with 1 Stress cleared. When you choose a downtime move that clears Stress on yourself, your companion clears an equal number of Stress. LEVELING UP YOUR COMPANION When your character levels up, choose one available option for your companion from the following list and mark it on your sheet. Intelligent: Your companion gains a permanent +1 bonus to a Companion Experience of your choice. Light in the Dark: Use this as an additional Hope slot your character can mark. Creature Comfort: Once per rest, when you take time during a quiet moment to give your companion love and attention, you can gain a Hope or you can both clear a Stress. Armored: When your companion takes damage, you can mark one of your Armor Slots instead of marking one of their Stress. Vicious: Increase your companion’s damage dice or range by one step (d6 to d8, Close to Far, etc.). Resilient: Your companion gains an additional Stress slot. Bonded: When you mark your last Hit Point, your companion rushes to your side to comfort you. Roll a number of d6s equal to the unmarked Stress slots they have and mark them.

Anyone in this cloud can’t see outside of it, and anyone outside of it can’t see in. You’re considered Cloaked from any adversary for whom the cloud blocks line of sight.

ROGUE Rogues are scoundrels, often in both attitude and practice. Broadly known as liars and thieves, the best among this class move through the world anonymously. Utilizing their sharp wits and blades, rogues trick their foes through social manipulation as easily as breaking locks, climbing through windows, or dealing underhanded blows. These masters of magical craft manipulate shadow and movement, adding an array of useful and deadly tools to their repertoire. Rogues frequently establish guilds to meet future accomplices, hire out jobs, and hone secret skills, proving that there’s honor among thieves for those who know where to look.

The following options are added to the list of benefits you can choose from when you use that feature: • When you mark 1 or more Hit Points, they can rush out to shield you, reducing the Hit Points marked by 1. • When you make a Presence Roll in conversation, they back you up. You can roll a d20 as your Hope Die. BACKGROUND QUESTIONS Answer any of the following background questions. You can also create your own questions. • What did you get caught doing that got you exiled from your home community? • You used to have a different life, but you’ve tried to leave it behind.

You can mark a Stress to target an additional adversary within range with the same attack roll. Sparing Touch: Once per long rest, touch a creature and clear 2 Hit Points or 2 Stress from them. SPECIALIZATION FEATURE Devout: When you roll your Prayer Dice, you can roll an additional die and discard the lowest result. Additionally, you can use your “Sparing Touch” feature twice instead of once per long rest. MASTERY FEATURE Sacred Resonance: When you roll damage for your “Spirit Weapon” feature, if any of the die results match, double the value of each matching die. For example, if you roll two 5s, they count as two 10s. SERAPH Seraphs are divine fighters and healers imbued with sacred purpose. A wide array of deities exist within the realms, and thus numerous kinds of seraphs are appointed by these gods. Their ethos traditionally aligns with the domain or goals of their god, such as defending the weak, exacting vengeance, protecting a land or artifact, or upholding a particular faith. Some seraphs ally themselves with an army or locale, much to the satisfaction of their rulers, but other crusaders fight in opposition to the follies of the Mortal Realm. It is better to be a seraph’s ally than their enemy, as they are terrifying foes to those who defy their purpose. DOMAINS Splendor and Valor STARTING EVASION 9 STARTING HIT POINTS 7 CLASS ITEMS A bundle of offerings or a sigil of your god SERAPH’S HOPE FEATURE Life Support: Spend 3 Hope to clear a Hit Point on an ally within Close range.

The gifts of these wielders are passed down through families, even if the family is unaware of or reluctant to practice them. A sorcerer’s abilities can range from the elemental to the illusionary and beyond, and many practitioners band together into collectives based on their talents. The act of becoming a formidable sorcerer is not the practice of acquiring power, but learning to cultivate and control the power one already possesses. The magic of a misguided or undisciplined sorcerer is a dangerous force indeed. DOMAINS Arcana and Midnight STARTING EVASION 10 STARTING HIT POINTS 6 CLASS ITEMS A whispering orb or a family heirloom SORCERER’S HOPE FEATURE Volatile Magic: Spend 3 Hope to reroll any number of your damage dice on an attack that deals magic damage.

On a roll with Hope, you can place a d6 on this card instead of gaining a Hope, adding the die to the pool. You can store a number of Slayer Dice equal to your Proficiency. When you make an attack roll or damage roll, you can spend any number of these Slayer Dice, rolling them and adding their result to the roll. At the end of each session, clear any unspent Slayer Dice on this card and gain a Hope per die cleared. SPECIALIZATION FEATURE Weapon Specialist: You can wield multiple weapons with dangerous ease. When you succeed on an attack, you can spend a Hope to add one of the damage dice from your secondary weapon to the damage roll.

WARRIOR Becoming a warrior requires years, often a lifetime, of training and dedication to the mastery of weapons and violence. While many who seek to fight hone only their strength, warriors understand the importance of an agile body and mind, making them some of the most sought-after fighters across the realms. Frequently, warriors find employment within an army, a band of mercenaries, or even a royal guard, but their potential is wasted in any position where they cannot continue to improve and expand their skills. Warriors are known to have a favored weapon; to come between them and their blade would be a grievous mistake.

Some wizards dedicate their lives to mastering a particular school of magic, while others learn from a wide variety of disciplines. Many wizards become wise and powerful figures in their communities, advising rulers, providing medicines and healing, and even leading war councils. While these mages all work toward the common goal of collecting magical knowledge, wizards often have the most conflict within their own ranks, as the acquisition, keeping, and sharing of powerful secrets is a topic of intense debate that has resulted in innumerable deaths. DOMAINS Codex and Splendor STARTING EVASION 11 STARTING HIT POINTS 5 CLASS ITEMS A book you’re trying to translate or a tiny, harmless elemental pet WIZARD’S HOPE FEATURE Not This Time: Spend 3 Hope to force an adversary within Far range to reroll an attack or damage roll.

The following section describes each ancestry in Daggerheart and the physical characteristics shared by members of that ancestry. That said, you can decide that your character possesses characteristics that aren’t “standard” or “average” for that ancestry. We encourage you to look to the art for inspiration and explore the diversity within individual ancestries as you craft your character’s appearance. We hope this section provides a window into the various physicalities of the creatures that populate Daggerheart. As you play and meet members of each ancestry, you’ll have the opportunity to learn about the nuances and unique qualities among them. You’ll also notice that within the world of Daggerheart, the term “people” is used to refer to all ancestries, as individuals from all lineages possess unique characteristics and cultures, as well as personhood. Some ancestries are described using the term “humanoid.” This does not refer to that specific ancestry having any relation to “humans,” the distinct ancestry within Daggerheart. Specifically, it refers to the set of physical characteristics readers will recognize from their own anatomy, such as bipedal movement, upright posture, facial layout, and more. These traits vary by ancestry and individual, though “humanoid” should still provide a useful frame of reference. Each ancestry has two ancestry features. While some features (such as the ability to fly) are directly tied to an ancestry’s anatomy, you ultimately get to determine your character’s physical form. If you decide that your faerie character never had wings or lost theirs, you can work with the GM to replace the “Wings” feature that grants faeries flight. It’s likewise up to you to decide how important your character’s appearance is to their story.

They can resemble humanoids, animals, or even inanimate objects. Like organic beings, their bodies come in a wide array of sizes. Because of their bespoke construction, many clanks have highly specialized physical configurations. Examples include clawed hands for grasping, wheels for movement, or built-in weaponry. Many clanks embrace body modifications for style as well as function, and members of other ancestries often turn to clank artisans to construct customized mobility aids and physical adornments. Other ancestries can create clanks, even using their own physical characteristics as inspiration, but it’s also common for clanks to build one another. A clank’s lifespan extends as long as they’re able to acquire or craft new parts, making their physical form effectively immortal. That said, their minds are subject to the effects of time, and deteriorate as the magic that powers them loses potency. ANCESTRY FEATURES Purposeful Design: Decide who made you and for what purpose. At character creation, choose one of your Experiences that best aligns with this purpose and gain a permanent +1 bonus to it. Efficient: When you take a short rest, you can choose a long rest move instead of a short rest move. 53 Chapter 1: Ancestry"

All drakona have thick scales that provide excellent natural armor against both attacks and the forces of nature. They are large in size, ranging from 5 feet to 7 feet on average, with long sharp teeth. New teeth grow throughout a Drakona’s approximately 350-year lifespan, so they are never in danger of permanently losing an incisor. Unlike their dragon ancestors, drakona don’t have wings and can’t fly without magical aid. Members of this ancestry pass down the element of their breath through generations, though in rare cases, a drakona’s elemental power will differ from the rest of their family’s. ANCESTRY FEATURES Scales: Your scales act as natural protection. When you would take Severe damage, you can mark a Stress to mark 1 fewer Hit Points. Elemental Breath: Choose an element for your breath (such as electricity, fire, or ice). You can use this breath against a target or group of targets within Very Close range, treating it as an Instinct weapon that deals d8 magic damage using your Proficiency. 54 Chapter 1: Ancestry\n-- 55 of 415 --"

Their average height ranges from 4 to 5 ½ feet, and they are often broad in proportion to their stature. Their skin and nails contain a high amount of keratin, making them naturally resilient. This allows dwarves to embed gemstones into their bodies and decorate themselves with tattoos or piercings. Their hair grows thickly—usually on their heads, but some dwarves have thick hair across their bodies as well. Dwarves of all genders can grow facial hair, which they often style in elaborate arrangements. Typically, dwarves live up to 250 years of age, maintaining their muscle mass well into later life.

Their ears vary in size and pointed shape, and as they age, the tips begin to droop. While elves come in a wide range of body types, they are all fairly tall, with heights ranging from about 6 to 6 ½ feet. All elves have the ability to drop into a celestial trance, rather than sleep. This allows them to rest effectively in a short amount of time. Some elves possess what is known as a “mystic form,” which occurs when an elf has dedicated themself to the study or protection of the natural world so deeply that their physical form changes. These characteristics can include celestial freckles, the presence of leaves, vines, or flowers in their hair, eyes that flicker like fire, and more. Sometimes these traits are inherited from parents, but if an elf changes their environment or magical focus, their appearance changes over time. Because elves live for about 350 years, these traits can shift more than once throughout their lifespan. ANCESTRY FEATURES Quick Reactions: Mark a Stress to gain advantage on a reaction roll.

These characteristics cover a broad spectrum from humanoid to insectoid—some possess additional arms, compound eyes, lantern organs, chitinous exoskeletons, or stingers. Because of their close ties to the natural world, they also frequently possess attributes that allow them to blend in with various plants. The average height of a faerie ranges from about 2 feet to 5 feet, but some faeries grow up to 7 feet tall. All faeries possess membranous wings and they each go through a process of metamorphosis. The process and changes differ from faerie to faerie, but during this transformation each individual manifests the unique appearance they will carry throughout the rest of their approximately 50-year lifespan.

Though their appearances may vary, most fauns have a humanoid torso and a goatlike lower body covered in dense fur. Faun faces can be more caprine or more humanlike, and they have a wide variety of ear and horn shapes. Faun horns range from short with minimal curvature to much larger with a distinct curl. The average faun ranges from 4 feet to 6 ½ feet tall, but their height can change dramatically from one moment to the next based on their stance. The majority of fauns have proportionately long limbs, no matter their size or shape, and are known for their ability to deliver powerful blows with their split hooves. Fauns live for roughly 225 years, and as they age, their appearance can become increasingly goatlike. ANCESTRY FEATURES Caprine Leap: You can leap anywhere within Close range as though you were using normal movement, allowing you to vault obstacles, jump across gaps, or scale barriers with ease.

Some have faces that are a blend of humanoid and bison, ox, cow, or other bovine creatures. Others, often referred to as minotaurs, have heads that entirely resemble cattle. They are tall and muscular creatures, with heights ranging from around 5 feet to 7 feet, and possess remarkable strength no matter their age. Some firbolgs are known to use this strength to charge their adversaries, an action that is particuarly effective for those who have one of the many varieties of horn styles commonly found in this ancestry. Though their unique characteristics can vary, all firbolgs are covered in fur, which can be muted and earth-toned in color, or come in a variety of pastels, such as soft pinks and blues. On average, firbolgs live for about 150 years.

They can be either more humanoid or more fungal in appearance, and they come in an assortment of colors, from earth tones to bright reds, yellows, purples, and blues. Fungril display an incredible variety of bodies, faces, and limbs, as there’s no single common shape among them. Even their heights range from a tiny 2 feet tall to a staggering 7 feet tall. While the common lifespan of a fungril is about 300 years, some have been reported to live much longer. They can communicate nonverbally, and many members of this ancestry use a mycelial array to chemically exchange information with other fungril across long distances. ANCESTRY FEATURES Fungril Network: Make an Instinct Roll (12) to use your mycelial array to speak with others of your ancestry. On a success, you can communicate across any distance.

On average, they range from 4 feet to 6 feet in height, and their head and body shapes can resemble any type of turtle. Galapa come in a variety of earth tones—most often shades of green and brown— and possess unique patterns on their shells. Members of this ancestry can draw their head, arms, and legs into their shell for protection to use it as a natural shield when defensive measures are needed. Some supplement their shell's strength or appearance by attaching armor or carving unique designs, but the process is exceedingly painful.

Adult giants range from 6 ½ to 8 ½ feet tall and are naturally muscular, regardless of body type. They are easily recognized by their wide frames and elongated arms and necks. Though they can have up to three eyes, all giants are born with none and remain sightless for their first year of life. Until a giant reaches the age of 10 and their features fully develop, the formation of their eyes may fluctuate. Those with a single eye are commonly known as cyclops.

With keen hearing and sharp eyesight, they perceive details both at great distances and in darkness, allowing them to move through less-optimal environments with ease. Their skin and eye colors are incredibly varied, with no one hue, either vibrant or subdued, more dominant than another. A typical goblin stands between 3 feet and 4 feet tall, and each of their ears is about the size of their head. Goblins are known to use ear positions to very specific effect when communicating nonverbally.

On average, halflings are 3 to 4 feet in height, and their ears, nose, and feet are larger in proportion to the rest of their body. Members of this ancestry live for around 150 years, and a halfling’s appearance is likely to remain youthful even as they progress from adulthood into old age. Halflings are naturally attuned to the magnetic fields of the Mortal Realm, granting them a strong internal compass. They also possess acute senses of hearing and smell, and can often detect those who are familiar to them by the sound of their movements.

They are the descendants of demons from the Circles Below. On average, infernis range in height from 5 feet to 7 feet and are known to have long fingers and pointed nails. Some have long, thin, and smooth tails that end in points, forks, or arrowheads. It’s common for infernis to have two or four horns—though some have crowns of many horns, or only one. These horns can also grow asymmetrically, forming unique, often curving, shapes that infernis enhance with carving and ornamentation. Their skin, hair, and horns come in an assortment of colors that can include soft pastels, stark tones, or vibrant hues, such as rosy scarlet, deep purple, and pitch black. Infernis possess a “dread visage” that manifests both involuntarily, such as when they experience fear or other strong emotions, or purposefully, such as when they wish to intimidate an adversary. This visage can briefly modify their appearance in a variety of ways, including lengthening their teeth and nails, changing the colors of their eyes, twisting their horns, or enhancing their height. On average, infernis live up to 350 years, with some attributing this lifespan to their demonic lineage.

They have smooth (though sometimes warty) moist skin and eyes positioned on either side of their head. Some ribbets have hind legs more than twice the length of their torso, while others have short limbs. No matter their size (which ranges from about 3 feet to 4 ½ feet), ribbets primarily move by hopping. All ribbets have webbed appendages, allowing them to swim with ease. Some ribbets possess a natural green-and-brown camouflage, while others are vibrantly colored with bold patterns. No matter their appearance, all ribbets are born from eggs laid in the water, hatch into tadpoles, and after about 6 to 7 years, grow into amphibians that can move around on land.

While their appearance reflects all simian creatures, from the largest gorilla to the smallest marmoset, their size does not align with their animal counterparts, and they can be anywhere from 2 to 6 feet tall. All simiah can use their dexterous feet for nonverbal communication, work, and combat. Additionally, some also have prehensile tails that can grasp objects or help with balance during difficult maneuvers. These traits grant members of this ancestry unique agility that aids them in a variety of physical tasks.

Anyone’s appearance and skill set can be shaped by blood, magic, proximity, or a variety of other factors. If you decide that your character is a descendant of multiple ancestries and you want to mechanically represent that in the game, use the steps below: STEP 1: DETERMINE ANCESTRY COMBINATION When you choose an ancestry at character creation, write down how your character identifies themself in the Heritage section of your character sheet. For example, your ancestry could be “goblin-orc,” or just “goblin” (with orc in their lineage), or a name you choose, like “toothling.” STEP 2: CHOOSE ANCESTRY FEATURES Work with your GM to choose two features from the ancestries in your character’s lineage. You must choose the first feature from one ancestry and the second from another. Write both down on a notecard you can keep with your other cards or next to your character sheet. For example, if you are making a goblin-orc, you might take the “Surefooted” and “Tusks” features or the “Sturdy” and “Danger Sense” features. You can’t take both the “Surefooted” and “Sturdy” features. If your character's heritage includes more than two ancestries, you only choose features from two. You can represent additional ancestries through their appearance or backstory. INFERNIS-RIBBET \"HORNED TOAD\" FAERIE-SIMIAH \"FLITTERIN\" FUNGRIL-GALAPA \"SHROOMSHELL\" 71 Chapter 1: Ancestry"

Though a character might have been a member of numerous communities during their upbringing, this choice represents the one they feel had the most influence over their personality and current skill set. As with ancestries, describing the characteristics of a collective is nuanced, as people always view others through the lens of their own experience. For example, while a seaborne sailor might feel their own community is particularly strict, a character from an orderborne metropolis might find that group very changeable. An individual’s relationship with their community also creates a wide variety of experiences. If your character has fallen out with the people that defined their upbringing, they might continue to carry that influence but also strive to live differently than they were taught. As you explore the communities in this section, imagine the variety of ways they might manifest in your game. Some community cards reference locations, others an ethos, and others a common goal, but no two places that fall under the same category are identical. If one wanderborne caravan travels the world willingly and another was expelled from their home by force, each community’s material trappings and their people’s feelings about their lifestyle would be very different. When you build your character, you can draw inspiration from communities other than the one you’ve chosen. As always, this aspect of the game is meant to be utilized in the way that best serves your group. Each community has a community feature granted to your character by their community that can be utilized in play. Tip: Each community entry suggests six adjectives that you can use as inspiration when crafting a character. If you’d like, choose one or more of these words (or roll a d6) to help develop your character’s personality, their relationship with their upbringing or peers, or even the demeanor with which they interact with the rest of their party.

HIGHBORNE 72 Chapter 1: Community\n-- 73 of 415 --\nHIGHBORNE Being part of a highborne community means you're accustomed to a life of elegance, opulence, and prestige within the upper echelons of society. Traditionally, members of a highborne community possess incredible material wealth. While this can take a variety of forms depending on the community—including gold and other minerals, land, or controlling the means of production—this status always comes with power and influence. Highborne place great value on titles and possessions, and there is little social mobility within their ranks. Members of a highborne community often control the political and economic status of the areas in which they live due to their ability to influence people and the economy with their substantial wealth. The health and safety of the less affluent people who live in these locations often hinges on the ability of this highborne ruling class to prioritize the well-being of their subjects over profit. Highborne are often amiable, candid, conniving, enterprising, ostentatious, and unflappable.

In such a case, it’s not uncommon for orderborne to provide soldiers for hire to other cities or countries. Orderborne are often ambitious, benevolent, pensive, prudent, sardonic, and stoic.

Those who’ve lived in the mountains often consider themselves hardier than most because they’ve thrived among the most dangerous terrain many continents have to offer. These groups are adept at adaptation, developing unique technologies and equipment to move both people and products across difficult terrain. As such, ridgeborne grow up scrambling and climbing, making them sturdy and strong-willed. Ridgeborne localities appear in a variety of forms—some cities carve out entire cliff faces, others construct castles of stone, and still more live in small homes on windblown peaks. Outside forces often struggle to attack ridgeborne groups, as the small militias and large military forces of the mountains are adept at utilizing their high-ground advantage. Ridgeborne are often bold, hardy, indomitable, loyal, reserved, and stubborn.

Seaborne communities are built, both physically and culturally, around the specific waters they call home. Some of these groups live along the shore, constructing ports for locals and travelers alike. These harbors function as centers of commerce, tourist attractions, or even just a safe place to lay down one’s head after weeks of travel. Other seaborne live on the water in small boats or large ships, with the idea of “home” comprising a ship and its crew, rather than any one landmass. No matter their exact location, seaborne communities are closely tied to the ocean tides and the creatures who inhabit them. Seaborne learn to fish at a young age, and train from birth to hold their breath and swim in even the most tumultuous waters. Individuals from these groups are highly sought after for their sailing skills, and many become captains of vessels, whether within their own community, working for another, or even at the helm of a powerful naval operation. Seaborne are often candid, cooperative, exuberant, fierce, resolute, and weathered. COMMUNITY FEATURE Know the Tide: You can sense the ebb and flow of life. When you roll with Fear, place a token on your community card. You can hold a number of tokens equal to your level.

Members of slyborne communities are brought together by their disreputable goals and their clever means of achieving them. Many people in these communities have an array of unscrupulous skills: forging, thievery, smuggling, and violence. People of any social class can be slyborne, from those who have garnered vast wealth and influence to those without a coin to their name. To the outside eye, slyborne might appear to be ruffians with no loyalty, but these communities possess some of the strictest codes of honor which, when broken, can result in a terrifying end for the transgressor. Slyborne are often calculating, clever, formidable, perceptive, shrewd, and tenacious.

Many underborne live right beneath the cities and villages of other collectives, while some live much deeper. These communities range from small family groups in burrows to massive metropolises in caverns of stone. In many locales, underborne are recognized for their incredible boldness and skill that enable great feats of architecture and engineering. Underborne are regularly hired for their bravery, as even the least daring among them has likely encountered formidable belowground beasts, and learning to dispatch such creatures is common practice amongst these societies. Because of the dangers of their environment, many underborne communities develop unique nonverbal languages that prove equally useful on the surface. Underborne are often composed, elusive, indomitable, innovative, resourceful, and unpretentious.

Unlike many communities that are defined by their locale, wanderborne are defined by their traveling lifestyle. Because of their frequent migration, wanderborne put less value on the accumulation of material possessions in favor of acquiring information, skills, and connections. While some wanderborne are allied by a common ethos, such as a religion or a set of political or economic values, others come together after shared tragedy, such as the loss of their home or land. No matter the reason, the dangers posed by life on the road and the choice to continue down that road together mean that wanderborne are known for their unwavering loyalty. Wanderborne are often inscrutable, magnanimous, mirthful, reliable, savvy, and unorthodox. COMMUNITY FEATURE Nomadic Pack: Add a Nomadic Pack to your inventory.

Wildborne communities are defined by their dedication to the conservation of their homelands, and many have strong religious or cultural ties to the fauna they live among. This results in unique architectural and technological advancements that favor sustainability over short-term, high-yield results. It is a hallmark of wildborne societies to integrate their villages and cities with the natural environment and avoid disturbing the lives of the plants and animals. While some construct their lodgings high in the branches of trees, others establish their homes on the ground beneath the forest canopy. It’s not uncommon for wildborne to remain reclusive and hidden within their woodland homes. Wildborne are often hardy, loyal, nurturing, reclusive, sagacious, and vibrant.

ADJUSTING ABILITIES AND SPELLS Some abilities and spells in Daggerheart designate the use of particular assets and senses, including sight, sound, touch, and movement. Like players, characters can be blind, deaf, or mute, have disabilities or limb differences, or possess any number of unique qualities that occur among individuals. Just as there is no set style for weapons combat, there is no set style of spellcasting within Daggerheart. No spell requires specific language or motions. For example, sign language is equally viable for a Wordsmith bard as anything spoken aloud. If instructions in the game aren't a good fit for your character's abilities (such as a blind PC’s spell affecting “a target you can see”), work with your GM to adjust the requirements of that effect. For example, you might choose to make one of the following adjustments to the rules or campaign: • Utilize another sense (“a target you can hear”) • Specify the mechanical range (“within Close range”) • Add narrative character details (the PC uses an aid or magical means to perceive the target) • Address it through worldbuilding (the Mortal Realm is accessible for disabled characters) Supporting the enjoyment of everyone at the table means modifying the spells, abilities, and other aspects of Daggerheart as you see fit. We invite you to adjust the flavor of cards based on the lines and veils established by the group (see the “Session Zero and Safety Tools” section on page 169). For example, a player might want their druid to use the Conjure Swarm spell, but either they or another player feel uncomfortable with bugs. In that case, they could conjure other objects such as flower petals, small birds, or even a specific bug (such as a butterfly) that everyone is comfortable with. All players, including the GM, should abide by the customizations made to accommodate one another. 82 Chapter 1: Additional Player Guidance"

Equality, disability, accessibility, and accommodations are a meaningful part of fantasy worldbuilding. For players interested in exploring these elements at the table, it’s important to take care to avoid stereotypes and learn from disabled people themselves. DISABLED IDENTITY Like other marginalizations—such as race, gender, and sexuality— disability is just as much an identity as a state of being. When playing a disabled character, it’s important to remember that disabilities are a part of people, not a mask they can take off. Different individuals have different experiences with their disability, such as how long they’ve been disabled, how society has treated them because of it, and how accommodations for their disability are handled. All of these elements are important to consider when building a disabled character, NPC, or fantasy world with accommodations. Disability is a broad category, and some are more visible— both literally and metaphorically—than others. Some disabilities commonly touched on and explored at the table include limb difference, low mobility and mobility aids, low vision, hearing loss, neurodivergence, and mental illness. Mobility aids and prosthetics are most commonly included in disabled representation, but it is also important to remember that there are countless “invisible” disabilities, such as chronic illnesses, chronic pain, genetic disorders, and autoimmune conditions. Neurodivergence—a blanket term that covers autism, ADHD, learning or cognitive disabilities, PTSD, and more—and mental illness can also sometimes be considered invisible disabilities. When building an inclusive world, it is important to consider disabled people from all walks of life, not just those who are most visible. MOBILITY AIDS, PROSTHETICS, AND ACCESSIBILITY TOOLS IN FANTASY A key aspect of playing and including disabled characters in your narratives is ensuring that accessibility tools are a part of the setting. “Accessibility tools” is a broad category for anything that makes the world more navigable for a disabled person, from glasses and hearing aids to prosthetics, wheelchairs, canes, and more. These mobility aids and accessibility tools can take inspiration from real life, using modern technology or historical reference. People have invented new ways to help disabled people access the world for thousands of years. But you should also feel empowered to get fun and fantastical with it—maybe a prosthetic grown from plants and vines, or a wheelchair that floats using magic better align with your PC or the campaign. If you’d like to implement a mobility aid mechanically, see the “Combat Wheelchair” section on page 122. TELLING DISABLED STORIES When playing a disabled character, or when including disabled characters as central elements in the plot, it’s important to know what sort of story you’re telling. Is the adventurer’s disability a central element of their character? Is it part of their backstory or something they gained as part of their adventures? How do they engage with that part of their identity—are they proud of their disability, coming to terms with it, or looking for new coping strategies? All of these stories are valid explorations and will have different implications and directions for your character’s journey throughout the narrative. Some players will want mechanical involvement for their disabilities, while others will want more narrative flavor without the mechanical aspects. Above all, make sure to collaborate on the worlds you build, the characters you create, and the stories you tell. Be open to adjustment and change, and take care of yourself and your fellow players. The game will be safer, richer, and more fun if everyone has a seat at the table. 83 Chapter 1: Additional Player Guidance"

Though every individual in the blind/VI community has their own experiences and preferences, here are a few tips on how to play a blind/VI character respectfully. First, consider the following when developing their backstory: • If your character was born blind/VI, remember that from very young ages, blind/VI children develop their own methods to interact with the world. • If your character wasn’t born blind/VI, what caused, or is causing them, to lose their vision? A sudden loss of sight can be traumatic, creating a sense of helplessness until they learn ways to adapt. • If your character is visually impaired, what level of sight do they have? Do they see only shadows and light? Or are things blurry blobs at a distance? • Does your character want to gain or regain their sight? Not all blind/VI individuals care about “curing” their sight, especially if they’re born that way. It’s hard to miss something they have never had, and some treasure their unique interpretation of the world. On the other hand, those who’ve lost their vision might wish to regain it. • Will your character use a cane? Blind/VI people don’t use canes to “see”; rather, they use them to gather information about the surface they’re walking on (by sound or how far their cane sinks into the ground), inclines or descents, and the edges of objects around them. • Does your character have a service animal or familiar? Blind/VI people develop close bonds with their service animals, and these companions alert them of potential danger or obstacles, guide them, and bring them items they need. While characters who weren’t born blind/ VI could potentially see through the eyes of a familiar, a character who was born blind might not understand the images a familiar projects into their mind, as they haven’t experienced sight and don’t have the necessary context. Strive to give blind/VI PCs and NPCs the same level of independence and function as other characters in your game, and make them common enough to let others know they not only exist in your world, they thrive. When roleplaying, you’re encouraged to include descriptions that go beyond appearance. Blind/VI people do not inherently have heightened smell or hearing, but these senses can inform them about their environment. Think about an area’s scent, temperature, wind flow, and more. Describe obstacles, people, and enemies in relation to their current position, such as stating that someone is “several paces in front” of a character or referencing a clock face or compass (where the character is always standing in the middle). Above all, don’t be afraid to play a blind/VI character and open yourself up to these roleplaying opportunities, experiences, and perspectives. PLAYING A DEAF CHARACTER By Rogan Shannon Deaf people exist on a wide spectrum ranging from mild to profound deafness. Some are deaf in one ear, but otherwise hear and speak, while others are entirely deaf and living in a fully visual world—or one of the many possible combinations in between. When you play a Deaf character, consider the many factors that influence how they move through their life. The following questions are a good place to start: • Have they been deaf since birth, or did they become deaf later in life from illness or injury? • How do they choose to communicate with their friends, loved ones, and the world at large? • Growing up, did they learn how to speak, use sign language, or a combination of the two? • If they don’t speak the predominant language, how do they communicate? Do they use paper and pen? Or do they have accommodations, magical or otherwise? • Is this person a loner, keeping to themself and interacting with people only when they have to, or are they part of a community of other Deaf people? As an accommodation for a Deaf character, the GM and players can flavor scenes using other senses. For example, the character might feel the rumbling of a dragon’s deep roar or the intense heat from a fire spell, rather than hearing the bellow or an explosion of flame. They may have a metallic taste in their mouth and hair standing up on their arms as the air crackles with electricity. Rather than hearing the groan of the undead, their nose might be assaulted with the pungent scent of rot. When roleplaying, be mindful of how you portray the character’s chosen communication mode. Either speak as you normally would or be intentional about how you do it. Above all, Deaf people are people. Play them as you would any other character while considering the added layer of how they move through the world differently due to communication needs. If you’re able, don’t hesitate to ask someone Deaf for ideas and feedback. 84 Chapter 1: Additional Player Guidance"

Flow of the Game In a session of Daggerheart, you and the other players go around the table describing what your characters do in the fictional circumstances that the GM sets up, building on each other’s ideas and working together to tell an exciting story. The mechanics of the game help facilitate this conversation, providing structure to the discussion and a way to resolve moments when there are several exciting possibilities for what happens next. Everyone at the table should ask questions and integrate the answers into the game. As a player, you’ll often ask clarifying questions about the scene: “Are there any guards outside the door?” or “What kind of weapon are they holding?” or “Can I jump across the gap safely?” The GM might answer questions directly: “There are four guards outside the door,” or “They’re weilding longswords.” They might also ask you to roll to determine the answer: “It’s raining and dark, so let’s see how well you jump the gap. Give me an Agility Roll, Difficulty 11.” In turn, the GM asks you questions and builds on those answers to create the fiction: “How are you able to sneak around this building so carefully?” or “What does the camp you’ve set up look like?” or “You’ve found a way to safely scramble up the wall— what made your climb easier than you anticipated?” This back and forth creates a collaborative conversation where everyone can meaningfully contribute to the fiction. For those familiar with roleplaying games, the flow of the game might come naturally, but if you’re new to this experience, it might not. The following steps outline an example of the gameplay loop that drives every session. This gameplay loop will be described in more detail in the upcoming sections.

STEP 2: THE PLAYERS AND GM ASK QUESTIONS The players ask questions to explore the scene in more depth, gathering information to help them decide their characters’ actions. When appropriate, the GM can ask the players to describe elements of a scene, leaving their own influence on the world. STEP 3: THE PLAYERS AND GM ANSWER QUESTIONS The GM responds to these questions by giving the players information their characters can easily obtain. The players also respond to any questions the GM poses to them. If they want more insight than what is readily available, the GM informs players what dice roll or action they must make to obtain more information. STEP 4: CHOOSE AND RESOLVE ACTIONS As the GM describes the scene and provides information, they lead the players to opportunities to take action—problems to solve, obstacles to overcome, mysteries to investigate, and so on. As the players pursue these opportunities, the GM helps facilitate their characters’ actions, and everyone works together to move the fiction forward based on the outcome. If the players aren’t compelled into action right away, the GM continues to provide more details, conflict, or consequences until they are. STEP 5: REPEAT THE CYCLE Because the scene has changed in some way, this process repeats from the beginning. EXAMPLE INTERACTION A noble just caught Nolan’s character, Lavelle, trying to steal an important letter from their bag in a busy market square at the center of town. “How many guards did you say this noble had?” Nolan asks Stella, the GM. “Two right there with him, and you suspect that there’s another two out-of-uniform and back in the crowd.” “Great. I’m by an alley, right? I want to back off and find a place to climb up to the rooftop before anyone can catch me.” “Sure thing,” Stella says. Based on the situation, she decides that Nolan doesn’t need to roll for Lavelle to accomplish what they want to do. “You’re fast, and thankfully the noble is the one who spotted you, not the guards—so you can scramble up without a roll. The guards will be following you, though, and once you’re on the roof, they’re going to draw their crossbows and start shooting.” Nolan asks, “How close are the buildings? Could I leap onto the next building’s roof?” “They’re not that far apart,” Stella says. “Certainly not any wider than what you’re used to from growing up in Downside. That’d be an Agility Roll to escape across the rooftops. But heads up—if you don’t succeed here, you’ll probably take some serious damage from the fall. It’s a long way down.” Lavelle has a +2 Agility, and Nolan spends a Hope to use Lavelle’s Scoundrel Experience, adding a +2 bonus to the roll to make the leap. “I know it’s dangerous, but I’ve done this kind of jump before.” Nolan gathers 4 character tokens to represent his Agility and Scoundrel bonuses, then rolls his Duality Dice. The Hope Die lands on a 9 and the Fear Die lands on 4. He combines those values together—adding up to 13—then adds his 4 character tokens for a total of 17. Because his Hope Die rolled higher than his Fear Die, Nolan tells the GM: “I rolled a 17 with Hope!” Stella nods. Nolan’s total of 17 is higher than the Difficulty of 15 she had in mind, and a success with Hope means there are no negative consequences for the action. “That’s more than enough to escape these guards. They’re armored and trying to take shots, but none of them get close to you—and they’re not good enough at jumping to risk a fall. By the time you’re two blocks away, you’ve completely lost them. Make sure to gain a Hope for that roll. But now you’re farther away from the noble and the letter you were trying to steal from him. What do you do?” 88 Chapter 2: Flow of the Game"

THE SPOTLIGHT Any time a character becomes the focus of a scene, they’re in the spotlight. Even if many characters are involved in a dramatic moment, there is often one character leading the action. This might be the PC pulling their ally to safety, the NPC haggling over the price of rare goods, or the adversary attacking with their foul weapon. The spotlight organically moves around the table as scenes unfold, but the mechanics of the game might also determine where the spotlight goes next. For example, if a player rolls with Fear on their Duality Dice during combat, the mechanics allow the GM to then spotlight an adversary to act against the heroes. ON YOUR TURN Daggerheart’s turns don’t follow a traditional, rigid format; you don’t have a set number of actions you can take or things you can do before play passes to someone else. Players should follow the natural flow of the fiction to figure out what happens next, bouncing the spotlight around the table to whoever it makes sense to focus on in that moment. However, all players should keep in mind who has recently had the spotlight and try to find opportunities to give every character a chance to act. OPTIONAL TOOL: SPOTLIGHT TRACKER If your group prefers tactical play or structured player turns, you can limit the number of actions each PC has available to them at a time. We recommend that you start with three, but you can increase or decrease the number as your table prefers. If you use this system, when a battle begins, every player places action tokens on their character sheets to represent how many actions they can take. Players then act as usual, and each time they make an action roll or perform a significant action while in the spotlight, they remove 1 token from their sheet. Collaborate with other players to pass play around the table, making moves and telling the story together. Even if you have multiple action tokens, see if any other players want a chance to act before you spend more than one in a row. Once every player has used all their available tokens, players refill their character sheet with the same number of tokens as before, then continue playing. MAKING MOVES When you decide to do something in the story and the spotlight shifts to you, your PC makes a move, which you describe to the group. A move is an action a character takes to advance the story, such as talking to another character, interacting with the environment, using a class feature or spell, or anything else a character can do within the scene. Some low-stakes moves automatically succeed—it’s easy to open an unlocked door. But while heroic, high-stakes moves often require a roll to determine the outcome—it’s hard to break down a barricaded door. When you make a move and the result of that action is in question, the fiction pauses while you make an action roll to see how things play out. MOVES IN COMBAT Since Daggerheart is a collaborative and conversational storytelling experience between the GM and players, combat has no initiative order, no rounds, and no distinct number of actions you can take while in the spotlight. Instead, fights play out narratively from moment to moment, just like noncombat scenes. This freeform combat gives players the freedom and opportunity to team up, respond on the fly to narrative changes in the scene, and follow the fiction. If they aren’t mechanically locked into combat, players might find it easier to choose a solution other than violence, such as having their characters flee from their opponents or come to a temporary truce with their enemies. GM MOVES AND ADVERSARY ACTIONS PCs aren’t the only ones who make moves—the GM can make a GM move (see the “Making Moves” section on page 149). GM moves can happen at nearly any time, but they most commonly occur when a PC rolls with Fear or fails an action roll. Typically, GM moves escalate the scene in an exciting and dangerous way. A new threat might emerge from the woods, the PCs could be separated by a sudden cave-in, or another similar action may significantly change the scene. When the GM is finished with their turn, play returns to the PCs. This creates a back-and-forth conversation as the story evolves organically between the GM and players. Many GM moves don’t require spending any resources, but the GM can spend Fear to make additional or more powerful moves, such as using an adversary or environment’s Fear move (see the “Fear” section on page 154). Tip: When the GM has the spotlight, PCs can’t use features that require spending resources or making rolls unless those actions specifically allow for it, such as reaction rolls or features that interrupt attack or damage rolls. 89 Chapter 2: Core Mechanics"

Choose two d12s of different colors (or if you prefer, different sizes or patterns)—one to represent Hope and the other to represent Fear. Your Duality Dice should be easily recognizable from each other at a glance. You’ll use these dice any time you make an action roll. Example: Quinn looks at their dice and decides on a blue d12 to represent Hope and a red d12 to represent Fear. Aliyah looks at her dice and chooses a yellow d12 to represent Hope and a purple d12 to represent Fear. Nolan thinks about using a black d12 with red inking as the Fear Die and a black d12 with white inking as his Hope Die, but decides to go with an orange d12 as his Hope Die instead so that it’s easier to identify. The Duality Dice represent the way the world pushes the character back or guides them forward throughout the story. Regardless of whether you succeed or fail on an action roll, the Duality of Hope and Fear influences how the scene evolves. ROLLING WITH HOPE AND FEAR One of your Duality Dice is your Hope Die, and the other is your Fear Die. Hope: When you roll your Duality Dice and the Hope Die rolls higher than the Fear Die, you roll with Hope. When this happens on an action roll, even if you fail, mark one of the Hope slots on your character sheet. You might also gain Hope from spells, abilities, or other events that happen during the game. Fear: When you roll your Duality Dice and the Fear Die rolls higher than the Hope Die, you roll with Fear. When this happens on an action roll, even if you succeed, the GM gains a Fear and there are consequences or complications that come from the action you were attempting. Critical Successes When you roll the Duality Dice and both dice roll the same number, that is a critical success. A critical success counts as a roll with Hope, even if you would’ve otherwise failed because the total is lower than the roll’s Difficulty. When you critically succeed on a roll, along with gaining a Hope, you also clear a Stress from your character sheet. Additionally, when you critically succeed on an attack roll, you deal extra damage as described in the “Damage Rolls” section on page 98. USING HOPE When you’ve gained Hope and recorded it on your character sheet, you can spend it to power special abilities, clearing it from your character sheet when you do. Your Hope carries over between sessions, but you can only hold a maximum of 6 Hope at a time, so we recommend you look for opportunities to spend it. Hope can be used in several ways: to Help an Ally, to Utilize an Experience, to Initiate a Tag Team Roll, or to Activate a Hope Feature. Help an Ally You can spend a Hope to Help an Ally who is making an action roll you could feasibly support. When you do this, describe how you’re helping and roll a d6 advantage die (see the “Advantage and Disadvantage” section on page 100). Any number of PCs can Help an Ally as long as they spend a Hope to do so. The ally being helped might also gain advantage on the roll from another source; in this case, they’d roll their own d6 advantage die. If the ally has gained advantage on a roll from multiple sources, they take the highest of all the advantage dice rolled and add the result to their action roll. Utilize an Experience You can spend a Hope to use one of your relevant Experiences on an action or reaction roll, adding its modifier to the result. If more than one Experience applies to the situation, you can spend an additional Hope for each Experience you want to use. Initiate a Tag Team Roll You can spend three Hope to initiate a Tag Team Roll between you and another PC in order to combine your efforts together in an exciting and scene-defining moment (see the “Tag Team Rolls” section on page 97). Activate a Hope Feature A Hope Feature is any effect that allows (or requires) you to spend Hope to activate its effects. If the text instructs you to “spend Hope,” you must spend the specified number of Hope, or you can’t trigger the Hope Feature. When using a Hope Feature, if you rolled with Hope for that action, the Hope you gain from that roll can be spent on that feature (or toward it, if it requires spending multiple Hope). If you didn’t roll with Hope, you’ll need to spend Hope you gained from previous rolls to activate the effect. Tip: Some effects only trigger on a success with Hope. This doesn’t mean you can spend Hope on a successful roll with Fear to get the effect; it means the effect only occurs when you roll with Hope and succeed on your action roll. You don’t need to spend Hope to activate these effects—they happen as long as the conditions of the roll are met. Each class has a unique Hope Feature, such as the guardian’s “Frontline Tank” or the wizard’s “Not This Time,” that underscores their class archetype and showcases their power. You can spend 3 Hope to activate these powerful abilities. If you find yourself maxing out on Hope, using your Hope Feature could give you the upper hand—but remember to look for opportunities to use Hope to help your allies and utilize your Experiences. You will be gaining Hope regularly, and it’s meant to be used often. 90 Chapter 2: Core Mechanics"

Instead, you face a complication or consequence. For example, your character learns only some of the information they need, suffers a counterattack from the adversary they just struck, or encounters an unexpected danger or hazard. If you fail the action roll where you rolled with Fear, those consequences or complications are worse. When you roll with Fear, you don’t record it on your character sheet. Instead, the GM gains a Fear and makes a move to reflect the complications of your Fear roll. The GM can spend the Fear they gain on effects such as spotlighting an adversary or making Fear moves (see the “Spending Fear” section on page 154). EVASION Your Evasion represents your character’s ability to avoid attacks and other unwanted effects from adversaries. This value sets the Difficulty for any roll a creature makes against you. Your base Evasion is determined by your class, but it can be modified by domain cards, equipment, conditions, and more. You get to describe what your character’s Evasion represents, flavoring it the same way you describe their actions. Take this opportunity to be creative, lean into the descriptions, and deepen your character. When an adversary misses them with an attack or other effect, they might deftly avoid it with acrobatic dodging or precise footwork or disrupt the attack with well-timed parries. They might even have a magical shield or enchanted object that wards off blows. Although these descriptions add to your character and the story your group is telling together, they don’t change the normal Evasion rules or give you special bonuses. For example, you might describe how your character uses a powerful burst of magic to redirect an arrow headed their way, but this doesn’t mean you can redirect the arrow back at the attacker and deal the damage to them instead. HIT POINTS AND DAMAGE THRESHOLDS Hit Points (HP) represent the physical injuries and discomforts your character experiences during their adventures. Your available Hit Points are determined by your class. When you take damage—usually when an adversary succeeds on an attack roll against your Evasion —you mark between 1 and 3 HP, representing the harm your character suffers. The number of HP you mark is determined by your damage thresholds. The threshold bar in the “Damage & Health” section of your character sheet (and at the top right of this page) show the three thresholds of damage you can take: Minor, Major, and Severe. A character’s level is added to their armor’s damage thresholds to determine their final damage thresholds. For example, a level 1 guardian wearing chainmail armor (with thresholds of 7/15) would start with the following thresholds. (See the “Using Armor” section on page 114 for more details.) DAMAGE & HEALTH Mark 1 HP Mark 2 HP Mark 3 HP STRESS hp MINOR Damage major Damage severe Damage Add your current level to your damage thresholds. MARKING HIT POINTS When the GM tells you to take damage, compare the damage total to your thresholds and mark a number of Hit Points determined by the threshold: • Severe damage is equal to or above your Severe threshold; you mark 3 HP. • Major damage is equal to or above your Major threshold but below Severe; you mark 2 HP. • Minor damage is anything below your Major threshold; you mark 1 HP. If you ever reduce incoming damage to 0 or less (typically by using a subclass or domain card), you don’t mark any HP. When you mark your last Hit Point, you must make a death move (see the “Death” section on page 106). Example: Using the example above, if a guardian’s incoming damage is 16 or higher, the damage is Severe and they mark 3 Hit Points. If the damage is 8 or higher (but below 16), the damage is Major and they mark 2 Hit Points. If the damage is below their Major threshold of 8, the damage is Minor and they mark 1 Hit Point. CLEARING HIT POINTS Any time you make a downtime move (see the “Downtime” section on page 105), you have the opportunity to clear some of your marked Hit Points. Additionally, as your character levels up, you can choose to permanently increase their number of Hit Points, making them more resilient against incoming attacks. OPTIONAL RULE: MASSIVE DAMAGE To make the game more dangerous, your table can implement a Massive threshold. If you ever take damage equal to double your Severe threshold, you mark 4 Hit Points. Example: Using the example above, if the guardian takes 32 damage or more, they take Massive damage and mark 4 Hit Points. 8 16 91 Chapter 2: Core Mechanics"

Some features, such as your spells or abilities, might require you to mark a Stress to use them. Additionally, the GM might offer you the chance to mark a Stress in exchange for succeeding at the action you’re taking. When you mark this Stress, consider the burden your character knowingly accepts. Does their anxiety increase as they use a new tactic in a high-stakes negotiation? Do they willingly dive back into danger and witness unimaginable horrors, knowing the toll it takes on them, to save an innocent life? Are they willing to take minor abrasions to fatally wound their foe? MARKING STRESS When an effect requires you to mark a Stress, do so on the slots on your character sheet. When you mark your last Stress, you become Vulnerable (see the “Conditions” section on page 102) until you clear at least 1 Stress. If you’re ever forced to mark 1 or more Stress but your slots are already full, you must instead mark 1 Hit Point. For example, if an adversary forces you to mark 3 Stress but your Stress is already filled, you instead mark 1 Hit Point. If you would take 2 Stress from an enemy and you have 1 Stress left, you would mark 1 Stress and 1 Hit Point. As with Hit Points, when you make downtime moves (see the “Downtime” section on page 105), you have the opportunity to clear some of your marked Stress. Additionally, as your character levels up, you can choose to permanently increase the amount of Stress they can withstand. Stress from Adversaries Some adversary actions require you to mark Stress. These actions represent the adversary’s ability to demoralize your character, exhaust them, or similarly push their physical and mental limits. Stress from Complications Your GM can tell you to mark Stress to represent a complication or consequence of an action, especially when a roll doesn’t go as well as it could have. For example, you might mark Stress while having a difficult conversation, clashing swords with a worthy foe, or committing an act of incredible bravery. The GM might also allow you to mark Stress to avoid a different complication. Stress from Moves Certain moves require you to mark Stress. Unless an effect states otherwise, you can’t mark Stress multiple times on the same feature to increase or repeat its effects (see the “Spending Resources” section on page 107). You can’t use a move that requires you to mark Stress if you don’t have slots to mark. ACTION ROLLS In each scene, the GM and players go back and forth describing what happens. If you make a move where the outcome is in question, and the success or failure of that move is interesting to the story, your move is an action and the GM calls for an action roll to determine the outcome. However, if an action is either easy to pull off without complication or impossible to perform, there’s no need to roll—you already know the result! When the GM (or your spell, attack, or ability) asks you to make an action roll, you’ll do so by rolling your Duality Dice. Each action roll follows four basic steps, which are summarized here and detailed in the sections that follow: STEP 1: PICK A CHARACTER TRAIT. The GM tells you which character trait best applies to the roll and sets a Difficulty for the roll (either openly or privately, at their discretion) based on the details of the scene. STEP 2: ADD EXTRA DICE AND MODIFIERS. You decide if any Experiences or other modifiers also apply, and grab character tokens, advantage or disadvantage dice, and other dice as needed. STEP 3: ROLL THE DICE. You roll your Duality Dice and any additional dice, then add up the result of the dice and the tokens. Tell the GM the total and which Duality Die rolled higher (“I got a 15 with Fear!”). STEP 4: RESOLVE THE SITUATION. You and the GM work together to resolve the outcome of your action. 92 Chapter 2: Core Mechanics"

You and the GM work together to resolve the outcome of your action. 92 Chapter 2: Core Mechanics\n-- 93 of 415 --\nSTEP 1: PICK A CHARACTER TRAIT Some actions require a certain character trait. In more flexible situations, depending on the scenario and how you’ve described what you’re trying to do, the GM might tell you which trait to use. Other times, the GM might ask you for more information to help decide: “You want to convince this guard to let you through. How are you speaking to them? Are you intimidating them? Tricking them?” Sometimes, more than one trait makes sense. In this case, the GM might ask you which trait best fits your intent, offer you a choice between two, or make a judgment call based on the situation at hand. “As you inform him about the important message you have for the king, I need you to make a roll to determine if he believes your lie. I’d say Presence is probably what best applies. Does that sound right to you?” Unless your action requires a certain trait, feel free to suggest one and describe why it’s a good match for what you’re doing. However, the GM always has final say over which trait applies. Roll Difficulty When you make an action roll, the roll will have a Difficulty— the number you need to reach or exceed when you roll. Often, the GM sets the roll’s Difficulty based on the situation and how effective your approach might be. Some features provide this Difficulty in parentheses after the listed roll, such as an Agility Roll (13) or a Spellcast Roll (10). If you’re making an action roll against an adversary, the Difficulty is found in their stat block. The GM can choose whether to share the Difficulty of an action or not. Even if they don’t tell you the Difficulty, they should make any potential consequences of your actions clear (unless the consequences aren’t something your character would reasonably know). For example, “You’re putting yourself in melee with this guard, so you might take a hit in return,” or “If you fail this jump, you might not make it to the other side.” STEP 2: ADD EXTRA DICE AND MODIFIERS Once you know which character trait to use, it’s time to figure out if any other dice or modifiers apply to the roll, such as the following: Duality Dice: You roll your Hope Die and Fear Die for every action roll. Advantage or Disadvantage: If you have advantage or disadvantage on the roll (see the “Advantage and Disadvantage” section on page 100), set aside that d6. If you’re rolling with disadvantage, make sure your disadvantage die is a distinct color, so you can remember which die to subtract from the result. Features: Some features allow you to add additional dice to your roll (or allow another character to give you a die). For example, a bard can give you a Rally Die, which you can add to an action, reaction, or damage roll of your choice. Set these dice aside for your roll. Other Dice: Occasionally, other effects (like a PC helping you with the action) might give you additional dice. Then count the modifiers that apply to your action roll, setting aside that many character tokens to help you keep track. Modifiers can include the following: Chosen Trait: Add or subtract the value of the trait you and your GM chose for this roll as the modifier. Experience: If you have an Experience (or several) that you think applies to the situation, describe how your Experience helps your chance of success, then spend a Hope per Experience to add its modifier to your roll. The GM might ask you for more information to justify that Experience, but you have final say (within reason) over whether your Experience applies. Class Features, Subclass Cards, and Domain Cards: Sometimes class features, subclass cards, and domain cards add a modifier to your roll, so keep an eye on your character sheet and cards. Other Bonuses or Penalties: Add or subtract bonuses or penalties from your equipment, items, or other sources. Tip: If you consistently use the same Experience on every roll, the GM will likely ask you to narrow the scope of that Experience or change it altogether. Experiences are meant to reflect the way your character has specialized in something important, not give you a bonus to all your actions. Counting Character Tokens Once you declare what modifiers you’re applying to your action roll, grab that many character tokens. Tokens aren’t dice; they’re counters you add to your hand to help total your results. Before you roll, total the sum of all of your modifiers and grab that many tokens. For example, if you have a −1 to Agility and a +2 modifier from an Experience you’re utilizing, you have a +1 total modifier to the roll, so set aside 1 token to represent that. Tip: Occasionally, your total modifier on a roll can be negative. In this case, you can still use tokens, but they’ll signify the number you need to subtract from the result, rather than add. If you’d like, you can use a token of a different color to indicate when your other tokens represent a negative modifier. 93 Chapter 2: Core Mechanics"

Add the results together (and subtract your disadvantage die, if necessary). Then, counting each token as 1, add or subtract your tokens to get the final result. Tell the GM the total number you rolled and which Duality Die rolled higher (“I rolled a 12 with Hope!”). ADDING BONUSES TO ROLLS Some features give you (or another player) a bonus to your action rolls, damage rolls, or reaction rolls. Unless otherwise specified, all bonuses must be added before you make the roll. For example, if a bard gives you a Rally Die, you must choose to use it before you roll, rather than after you see the results. STEP 4: RESOLVE THE SITUATION If your total meets or exceeds the Difficulty, the action succeeds—you get what you want. If the total is below the Difficulty, the action fails—you don’t get what you want—but with one exception! As described in the earlier “Duality Dice” section, if your Duality Dice both roll the same number, you critically succeed, even if your total wasn’t enough to meet the Difficulty. Based on the result of your roll, the GM uses the following guidelines to decide how the narrative moves forward: ON A CRITICAL SUCCESS… You get what you want and a little extra. You gain a Hope and clear a Stress. If you made an attack roll, you also deal extra damage (see the “Calculating Damage” section on page 98). ON A SUCCESS WITH HOPE… You pull it off well and get what you want. You gain a Hope. ON A SUCCESS WITH FEAR… You get what you want, but it comes with a cost or consequence. The GM gains a Fear. ON A FAILURE WITH HOPE… Things don’t go to plan. You probably don’t get what you want and there are consequences, but you gain a Hope. ON A FAILURE WITH FEAR… Things go very badly. You probably don’t get what you want, and a major consequence or complication occurs because of it. The GM gains a Fear. After you announce the result of your roll, the GM describes what happens next.

The GM, Stella, tells Aliyah to make an Agility Roll with a Difficulty of 15. Tabby has a +2 Agility, so Aliyah rolls the Duality Dice, adds them together, then adds 2 tokens (representing her +2 modifier from Agility) to get her total. Here are examples of the five possible results of her roll: FAILURE WITH FEAR Aliyah rolls 3 on the Hope Die and 6 on the Fear Die, then adds 2 from her Agility for a result of 11 with Fear. 11 is below the roll’s Difficulty. Stella gains Fear and, because play passes back to her on a failure, describes the mage making an attack roll in response to Tabby’s maneuver. The attack is successful, so the mage knocks her off the parapet with a blast of magical fire and deals damage. Tabby crashes down to the ground below and must find a way back up if she plans to face the mage head-on again. FAILURE WITH HOPE Aliyah rolls 6 on the Hope Die and 3 on the Fear Die, then adds 2 from her Agility. That’s an 11 with Hope. A total of 11 isn’t enough to make it across safely, so on a failure, Stella makes a move, narrating that the mage sees Tabby coming and makes an attack, which succeeds. The mage’s blast knocks Tabby off- balance, leaving her dangling from the parapet, her progress stalled and position precarious. Tabby gains a Hope, but her friends are still in the line of fire and might need to help her reach safety. SUCCESS WITH FEAR Aliyah rolls 5 on the Hope Die and a 9 on the Fear Die, then adds 2 from her Agility. That’s a 16 with Fear, so it’s a success. Stella gains Fear, then asks Aliyah to describe how she races across the parapet, dodging the mage’s blasts. After her description, Stella takes over, saying that once Tabby has crossed, she faces her foe head-on, blocking them from attacking the rest of the party. But as the consequence for a result with Fear—the mage reaches out with magic and crumbles the parapet behind Tabby, leaving her trapped and unable to move back to safety. At least the mage isn’t attacking her friends, right? SUCCESS WITH HOPE Aliyah rolls 10 on the Hope Die and 6 on the Fear Die, then adds 2 from her Agility. That’s an 18 with Hope, so it’s a success. She immediately gains a Hope, then Stella asks her to describe what it looks like as Tabby races across the parapet and interrupts the mage’s assault on the party. Since Aliyah rolled a success with Hope, Stella asks what the players want to do next. CRITICAL SUCCESS Aliyah rolls 8 on the Hope Die and 8 on the Fear Die. That’s a critical success! Tabby immediately gains a Hope and clears a Stress. Stella offers Aliyah a choice of two extra benefits— she can deal damage to the mage or gain advantage on the next roll against the mage. Aliyah describes how Tabby races across the parapet and lands a solid blow on the mage, not just stopping their attacks on the party, but dealing weapon damage as well. Since a critical success counts as a roll with Hope, Stella asks the players what they want to do next. STORY IS CONSEQUENCE In Daggerheart, every time you roll the dice, the scene changes in some way. There is no such thing as a roll where nothing happens, because the fiction constantly evolves based on the successes and failures of the characters. A failure doesn’t mean you simply don’t get what you want, especially if that would result in a moment of inaction. The game is more interesting when every action the players take yields an active outcome—something that develops the situation they’re in. For example, if you fail a roll to pick a lock, it’s not just that the door doesn’t open. On a failure with Hope, it might mean you can hear the rumble of footsteps coming down the hall behind you—the adversaries you previously escaped are getting close, and you have to hide, or find another way through. On a failure with Fear, the door might’ve been magically warded to keep thieves away, and its arcane alarm triggers. Meanwhile, on a success with Fear, you might succeed in unlocking the door, but you’re spotted by the adversaries within. These consequences are what make the game interesting and drive forward your shared adventure. Every GM and player has a different level of interest and comfort in this roll-by-roll improvisation. Some groups might prefer a largely predetermined world—for example, the GM could have previously decided there are two guards on patrol, and you roll simply to learn whether you unwittingly run into both of them, whether one rounds the corner but you catch them unawares, or whether you escape both guards without notice. In other groups, the GM might not have decided if there are guards at all—but after you roll a failure with Fear, the they quickly weave two guards into the story. Either approach is okay, and you’ll likely use a mix of both in each session! 95 Chapter 2: Core Mechanics"

However, some situations require special types of action rolls, which are detailed in the following sections. TRAIT ROLLS A trait roll is an action roll that calls for a specific character trait to be used. These rolls often appear on domain cards and say something like “Presence Roll” or “Agility Roll (12).” If there is a number in parentheses after the trait, that is the Difficulty you must meet to succeed on the roll. If there is no number, the Difficulty is set by the GM based on the circumstances. You can add your Experiences and other bonuses to a trait roll. If a feature affects a roll that uses a certain trait (such as an Agility Roll), it affects any roll that uses that trait (such as a Spellcast Roll or attack roll that uses Agility). For example, the katari’s ancestry feature “Feline Instincts,” which allows the katari to reroll an Agility Roll, can be used both on an Agility Roll to traverse dangerous terrain and on an attack roll made with a weapon that uses Agility. ATTACK ROLLS When you make an action roll with the intent to harm an adversary, you’re making an attack roll. Reference the weapon or spell you’re using for the attack to determine what trait it uses. We’ll talk more about Spellcast Rolls in the next section, but for a standard physical or magic weapon attack, use the character trait the weapon requires (see the “Equipment” section on page 112), as well as any applicable Experiences or other modifiers, and resolve it as you would a normal action roll. If you succeed, make a damage roll to determine how much damage the target takes. By default, each attack roll can only target one adversary. If a spell or ability allows you to target multiple adversaries, roll once and apply that result to all of the adversaries the attack can hit, unless otherwise specified. The attack is successful against all targets for which the attack roll result meets or exceeds their Difficulty. UNARMED ATTACK ROLLS When your character makes an attack without a weapon— for example, a punch or a kick—you make an attack roll using Strength or Finesse (though the GM might allow you to use another trait depending on how you describe the attack). On a success, you deal d4 physical damage using your Proficiency. SPELLCAST ROLLS Spellcast Rolls are a type of action roll used when you’re creating significant magical effects (typically with a domain card). To make a Spellcast Roll, your character must have a subclass that gives you a Spellcast trait (which you can find on the subclass foundation card). You use that trait when you make a Spellcast Roll. Like other trait rolls, Spellcast Rolls can have a set Difficulty, such as “Spellcast Roll (14).” If a Spellcast Roll can damage a target, it’s also considered an attack roll. You can’t make a Spellcast Roll unless you use a spell that calls for one, and the action you’re trying to perform must be within the scope of the spell. You can’t just make up magic effects that aren’t on your character sheet or cards. However, at the GM’s discretion, they might allow you to creatively apply an existing spell in an unusual way. Remember that you can always flavor your magic to match the character you’re playing, but that flavor won’t give you access to new effects. Example 1: A sorcerer is trying to reach a cliff high above him and doesn’t have a spell or ability that lets him get there. He can’t make a generic Spellcast Roll to have magic lift him up into the air and fly him to the cliff; he needs a specific spell or ability to accomplish this task. Example 2: To explain why their “Rune Circle” spell gives them protection from adversaries, a wizard wants to flavor that spell as an eruption of sparks from their wand that forms a galloping stallion circling around them. That’s awesome and should be highly encouraged, but if dealing extra damage to an adversary because of this narration falls outside the scope of the spell. When you cast a spell, the text tells you when the effect expires. It might be temporary (in which case the GM can spend Fear to end the spell), it might end at the next rest, or it might have another duration. If the spell doesn’t note an expiration, you choose when to end it, or it ends when the story changes in a way that would naturally stop the effect. If you ever want to end a spell earlier than its normal expiration, you can always choose to do so. Unless the spell says otherwise, you can cast and maintain the effects of more than one spell at the same time. 96 Chapter 2: Core Mechanics"

Each player then describes how their character collaborates on the task. The action’s leader makes an action roll as usual, while the other players make a reaction roll using whichever traits they and the GM decide fit best (see the upcoming “Reaction Rolls” section). They can use different traits for their reaction rolls if they wish. The leader’s action roll gains a +1 bonus for each reaction roll that succeeds and a −1 penalty for each reaction roll that fails. Tip: If you want to assist an individual ally with an action, you can use Help an Ally instead (see page 90). Example: The party has just retrieved a stolen amulet from an ancient stronghold, and they are rushing out as the structure collapses around them. The GM calls for a group action roll as they try to escape. The group elects Tabby the warrior to be the leader, since that character would best remember the path to the exit. The other characters each explain how they work with the party to escape: Shepherd the druid says they are running alongside Tabby to act as a second set of eyes in case there’s a faster route. The GM calls for an Instinct Reaction Roll. It’s a 19, a success, so they give Tabby an additional +1 bonus. The GM asks Shepherd to describe the shortcut they notice that allows for a quicker escape. Rune the wizard says that he wants to understand what kind of magic caused the collapse and potentially reverse it. The GM calls for a Knowledge Reaction Roll. It’s a 12, which isn’t quite enough, giving Tabby a −1 penalty. The GM asks Rune what causes him to fall behind for a moment. Lavelle the rogue says he notices that Rune looks like he’s not going to make it, so he turns back to reach out a hand in a moment of desperation, yelling, “I’ve got you! We’re not leaving you behind!” The GM calls for a Presence Reaction Roll. It’s a 16—a success—giving Tabby a +1 bonus. The GM asks Lavelle and Rune to describe how this rescue happens successfully. Now that everyone else has acted, Tabby takes the total of the modifiers, in this case +1, and makes an Agility Roll, hoping to lead the party to safety while dodging debris and pointing out hazards. She rolls a 16 with Fear. The GM gains a Fear and says that each character must mark a Stress—but they also emerge from the stronghold just in the nick of time, the ancient stones collapsing behind them. TAG TEAM ROLLS Once per session, each player can choose to spend 3 Hope and initiate a Tag Team Roll between their character and another PC. When you do, work with the other character’s player to describe how you combine your actions in a unique and exciting way. You both make separate action rolls, but before resolving the roll’s outcome, choose one of the rolls to apply for both of your results. On a roll with Hope, all PCs involved gain a Hope. On a roll with Fear, the GM gains a Fear for each PC involved. Tag Team Rolls are especially powerful on attack rolls. When you and a partner succeed on a Tag Team Roll attack, you both roll damage and add the totals together to determine the damage dealt. If the attacks deal different types of damage (physical or magic), you choose which type to deal. A Tag Team Roll counts as a single action roll for the purposes of any countdowns or features that track action rolls. Tip: Though you can only initiate one Tag Team Roll per session, you can be involved in multiple Tag Team Rolls. For example, you might spend 3 Hope to initiate a Tag Team Roll with a partner, and the same partner can later spend 3 Hope to initiate one with you. 97 Chapter 2: Core Mechanics"

A damage roll is composed of two parts: your Proficiency and damage dice. PROFICIENCY Your Proficiency reflects how skilled you are at wielding weapons. You start at 1 Proficiency and can increase this value to a maximum of 6 over the course of a campaign. Your Proficiency determines how many damage dice you roll on a successful attack with a weapon, though other abilities or spells use Proficiency as well. This value is not weapon-specific, and does not change or reset when you equip a new weapon. Tip: The effects of a spell or an ability might allow you to increase your Proficiency beyond the maximum of 6. DAMAGE DICE The damage dice used to make a damage roll are determined by the weapon, spell, or ability you’re using to make the attack. If the attack uses a weapon, you roll a number of your weapon’s damage dice equal to your Proficiency. You can find your weapon’s damage dice in the “Active Weapons” section of your character sheet. If the attack is coming from a spell on a domain card or class feature, the text tells you which damage dice you should roll. Any time a move tells you to deal damage using your Proficiency, you roll a number of dice equal to your Proficiency. Any time it tells you to deal damage using your Spellcast trait, you roll a number of dice equal to your Spellcast trait. Example: Aliyah's character Tabby has an ability that deals d8 damage using her Proficiency, which is 2. She rolls 2d8 when dealing damage. Miles's character Rune has a spell that deals d6 damage using his Spellcast trait, which is 3. He rolls 3d6 when dealing damage. As with action rolls, if you want to add a bonus to your damage roll, you must decide to do so before you roll. CALCULATING DAMAGE After rolling your damage dice, add their values together, then add any modifiers to determine the result. The GM marks Hit Points based on that damage. Tip: In Daggerheart, there’s a difference between damage and Hit Points. Damage is the result of your damage roll, including your damage dice and modifiers. Hit Points reflect how hard that damage affects the creature who’s taking it. The number of Hit Points a creature marks depends on factors such as their damage thresholds, armor, resistances, and immunities. DAMAGE WITHOUT MODIFIERS Some damage rolls tell you to roll a certain number and type of die without any modifiers. For example, “1d8 physical damage.” In this case, you simply roll as indicated and the result of that roll is the amount of damage you deal. Example: Aliyah makes an attack roll with her warrior’s broadsword and gets a 15, which is a success. Her Damage Proficiency is 2 and her broadsword’s damage dice are d8s, so she rolls 2d8 and gets a 3 and a 7, for 10 total damage. DAMAGE WITH MODIFIERS Some damage rolls come with modifiers, such as “2d6+2” or “3d8+5.” In these cases, you roll the dice, add their values together, then add the modifier to that total. This modifier is not affected by your Proficiency. Example: Nolan makes a successful attack with his improved shortbow, which deals d6+6 damage. He has a Proficiency of 3, so he rolls 3d6. The results are 3, 5, and 6, totaling 14. He then adds the modifier of +6, for a total of 20 physical damage to the target. CRITICAL SUCCESSES AND DAMAGE If your attack roll critically succeeds, your attack deals extra damage! Start with the highest possible value the damage dice can roll, and then make a damage roll as usual, adding it to that value. Example: Miles’s character Rune makes an attack against a target with his wand and rolls two 7s on the Duality Dice—a critical success. Rune has a Proficiency of 2, and the wand deals d6+1 magic damage, so Miles starts with the maximum possible roll of 2d6, for a total of 12 damage. Then, he rolls the 2d6 and they land on a 4 and 5, totaling 9. Finally, he adds the +1 modifier for a total of 22 magic damage. MULTIPLE SOURCES OF DAMAGE Whenever damage would be applied more than once to a creature during a PC’s move, the damage is always totaled before it’s applied to the adversary’s damage thresholds. For example, if a PC with orc ancestry makes a successful attack against a target in Melee range and decides to spend a Hope to use their “Tusks” feature (which gives them an extra 1d6 damage on a damage roll), they would roll their normal weapon damage and add a d6 to the result, then deal that total damage to the adversary. If this orc then decided—with the table’s consent—to keep the spotlight and make another attack, this is considered a separate move. When this attack resolves, its total damage is counted separately from the damage of the orc's first move. 98 Chapter 2: Core Mechanics"

Use the following rules to determine whether special circumstances affect a damage roll. DAMAGE TYPES Weapons, spells, and abilities deal one of two damage types: physical damage (phy) or magic damage (mag). Some mechanics interact with damage types to affect how damage is dealt or received—for example, a spell might double magic damage, a condition might make a character resistant to physical damage, or an adversary might be immune to a damage type altogether. • Physical damage is dealt through mundane physical blows, usually without the aid of magic. Most standard blades and bows deal physical damage. • Magic damage is dealt through magical means. Most harmful spells deal magic damage. DIRECT DAMAGE Direct damage is physical or magic damage that Armor Slots can’t be used to reduce. For example, if a character is Poisoned by a creature's attack, they might take 1d10 direct physical damage each time they act, which their Armor Slots can't be used to reduce. RESISTANCE AND IMMUNITY Some abilities, spells, items, and other effects grant resistance that reduces damage, or immunity that prevents it. If the text doesn’t specify whether resistance or immunity applies to physical or magic damage, the effect applies to both. When a creature has resistance to a damage type, they halve damage of that type before comparing it to their damage thresholds. For example, when your character deals 26 physical damage to a creature with physical resistance, the creature only takes 13 physical damage. If multiple features grant the same kind of resistance, they only count as one source of resistance. For example, if two different spells both provide a character resistance to physical damage, incoming damage is still only halved. When a creature has immunity to a damage type, they do not take any damage from an attack that deals damage of that type. If your character has resistance or immunity plus another way to reduce damage (such as marking an Armor Slot), apply the resistance or immunity first. You can then use other methods to reduce the damage further. If an attack deals both physical and magic damage, you can only benefit from resistance or immunity if you are resistant or immune to both damage types. REACTION ROLLS Some moves prompt a reaction roll. This is a roll in response to an attack or a hazard, representing your effort to avoid or withstand the effect. Reaction rolls work similarly to action rolls, except they don’t generate Hope, Fear, or additional GM moves. Additionally, other characters can’t help you on a reaction roll—every second counts, so you'll have to handle this alone! When you make a reaction roll, the GM tells you what trait to use, then you make a roll with the Duality Dice as if it were an action roll. As with action rolls, if you want to add a bonus to your reaction roll, you must decide to do so before you roll. An effect requiring a reaction roll often says something like: “The target must succeed on an Agility Reaction Roll (14) or take 3d12 physical damage.” In this case, if the target fails to meet or exceed the Difficulty of 14, they take the damage from the effect. Example: The GM describes a mage’s explosive spell hurtling toward Nolan’s rogue Lavelle, then asks Nolan to make a reaction roll using Agility. Nolan rolls his Duality Dice, adds his Agility, and gets a 19, beating the assigned Difficulty of 16. It’s a success! The GM asks Nolan to describe how Lavelle avoids the attack. If you critically succeed on a reaction roll, you don’t clear a Stress or gain a Hope, but you do ignore any effects that would still impact you on a success (such as taking damage or marking Stress). Adversaries also make reaction rolls, though they follow slightly different rules (see the “Adversary Reaction Rolls” section on page 161). 99 99 Chapter 2: Core Mechanics"

Advantage represents an opportunity that you seize to increase your chances of success. When you roll with advantage, you add a d6 advantage die to your total. Disadvantage represents an additional difficulty, hardship, or challenge you face when attempting an action. When you roll with disadvantage, you subtract a d6 disadvantage die from your total. Some of your abilities might automatically grant you advantage or impose disadvantage on adversaries, but the GM can also choose to give you advantage or disadvantage on any roll when it fits the story. Unique rules for advantage come into play when an ally is helping you with a roll, so see the earlier “Help an Ally” section on page 90 for more information. Advantage and disadvantage always cancel each other out when applied to the same roll, so you’ll never roll both at the same time. For example, if the GM gives you disadvantage on a roll but you gain advantage from a domain ability, the two cancel each other out and the roll is made without a d6 advantage or disadvantage die. In this way, if you have two sources of advantage and one of disadvantage, one of the advantage dice and the disadvantage die cancel each other out, so you would have advantage on the roll. NPCs can also roll with advantage (or disadvantage), but when they do, the GM rolls an additional d20 and picks the highest (or lowest) result (see the “Giving Advantage and Disadvantage” section on page 160). Tip: Some moves or effects require you to add or subtract a d6 for reasons other than advantage or disadvantage. If you find yourself both adding and subtracting a d6 for any reason, roll neither, since they cancel each other out. BATTLING ADVERSARIES The flow of combat in Daggerheart is malleable and driven by the dice. The player characters pass the spotlight between themselves, making moves until someone fails a roll or rolls with Fear, or until the GM spends a Fear to interrupt the players’ turns. When play passes to the GM, the GM can make a move to spotlight an adversary—and, if they wish, can spend any number of Fear to spotlight that many additional adversaries. A spotlighted adversary can take any action the fiction demands of them, but most of the time, they’ll do one of the following: • Move within Close range and make a standard attack. • Move within Close range and use an adversary action. • Clear a condition. • Sprint within Far or Very Far range on the battlefield. Conditions and ranges are described in the upcoming “Conditions” and “Maps, Range, and Movement” sections, but the following example provides a brief overview of what it looks like when the GM takes their turn. Once the GM has finished, play passes back to the PCs. Example: After Quinn makes an attack roll with Fear for their druid Shepherd, play moves to the GM. The GM spotlights a nearby adversary who is temporarily Vulnerable, and describes them breaking free from the vines that are binding them to remove the Vulnerable condition. The GM has 6 Fear available, so they spend 1 to spotlight the adversary Shepherd just hit with their shortstaff. The GM describes the adversary pulling their warhammer out of the mud and swinging at Shepherd’s ribs. The adversary succeeds on the attack, then rolls for damage and totals it for 9 physical damage. This damage falls above Shepherd’s Major threshold, but Quinn marks an Armor Slot and reduces the damage by one tier to Minor instead, marking 1 Hit Point. Spending another Fear to shift the spotlight again, the GM describes an additional adversary sprinting all the way across the battlefield to get to the massive bell that would signal reinforcements. As the adversary prepares to ring it, the GM returns play to the players, asking, “What do you want to do?” 100 Chapter 2: Core Mechanics"

Unless a domain card states otherwise, you can use it as many times as you wish, for as long as it remains in your loadout. LOADOUT AND VAULT You can have a maximum of five active domain cards in your loadout at any one time. Your subclass, ancestry, and community cards don’t count toward that limit and are always active. At lower levels, you won’t have enough cards that you need to make selections, but once you have six or more domain cards, you need to choose which to keep in your loadout and which to store in your vault. Cards in your loadout can be held in your hand, placed on the table next to your character sheet, or made accessible through other means. Do whatever makes it easiest to use them. Any cards in your loadout are considered active, and you’re free to use them during play. Your vault holds any domain cards that are inactive and not currently in your loadout. Vault cards should be kept somewhere out of the way, but close enough that they’re available if they need to be accessed during a session if you want to swap them into your loadout. A few features require you to permanently place a card in your vault. When this happens, that card is removed from play. You can’t move such a card back into your loadout by any means, nor can you choose it again when you gain a level. SWAPPING CARDS When you start a rest, you can swap cards between your loadout and your vault. You must do so before you use any downtime moves. If you have fewer than five cards in your loadout, you can add cards from your vault to your loadout until you have five active cards. When you’re not resting, you can still swap cards into your loadout, but it’s stressful to do so! To immediately switch a card from your vault to your loadout, mark a number of Stress equal to the vaulted card’s Recall Cost (located in the top right of the card next to the lightning bolt symbol). When you do, switch it for another domain card in your loadout and place that card into your vault. If you currently have fewer than five domain cards in your loadout, you can pay the Recall Cost and place a card from your vault into your loadout without trading out a card for it. Swapping When You Level Up If your loadout is full when you level up and gain a new card, you can immediately move one of your active cards into your vault and add the new card to your loadout at no cost. USAGE LIMITS Some domain cards have an exhaustion limit that restricts how often you can use that card (for example, once per long rest). If you use that card, you’ll need a way to remember that it’s temporarily unavailable. You might choose to take that card out of your hand and place it face down on the table, turn it on its side or upside down, or any other method to remind yourself that you’ve already used it. If a card allows for a certain number of uses, you could add a token to it each time you activate it to keep track of how many times you’ve used it. ADDING TOKENS TO CARDS A feature might ask you to add a number of tokens to a domain card. When you do, put the card on the table, grab the appropriate number of character tokens, and place them on the card. These tokens are used to track certain effects, but they don’t affect your ability to add tokens to your roll to represent your modifiers, or anything else you might need to use them for. If you still have tokens on your card at the end of a session and aren't told to clear them, ensure you track the number you have left to place back on that card at the beginning of the next session. Tip: Some spells or abilities remain in effect once you activate them. Unless stated otherwise, this does not prevent you from activating another spell or ability—you can use two (or more) at the same time. Recall Cost Domain Level 101 Chapter 2: Core Mechanics"

Recall Cost Domain Level 101 Chapter 2: Core Mechanics\n-- 102 of 415 --\nCONDITIONS Some features impose a condition on your character (or an adversary). These are effects that grant specific benefits or drawbacks to the target they are applied to. Daggerheart has three primary conditions—Hidden, Restrained, and Vulnerable—which are explained in the following sections. Some features apply other unique conditions whose effects are detailed within the text of the feature. Unless otherwise noted, the same condition can’t be stacked—applied more than once—on one target. HIDDEN While you’re out of sight from all foes and they don’t know where you are, you gain the Hidden condition. While Hidden, any rolls against you have disadvantage. After an adversary moves to where they would see you, you move into their line of sight, or you make an attack, you are no longer Hidden. Example: While scouting a temple to the Fallen Gods and investigating some large statues depicting ancient battles, Rune hears footsteps coming. He declares that he’s going to duck behind the statues and wait for whoever's approaching to pass. The GM decides that the statues provide ample cover and doesn’t call for a roll. Rune is now considered Hidden. The GM describes snippets of dialogue as two cultists walk right by Rune as he sticks to the shadows, then asks Rune what he wants to do next. If Rune had attacked the cultists as they passed, he’d have lost the Hidden condition after doing so. RESTRAINED When you gain the Restrained condition, you can’t move until this condition is cleared, but you can still take actions from your current position. VULNERABLE When you gain the Vulnerable condition, you’re in a difficult position within the fiction. This might mean you’re knocked over, scrambling to keep your balance, caught off guard, magically enfeebled, or anything else that makes sense in the scene. When a creature becomes Vulnerable, the players and GM should work together to describe narratively how that happened. While you are Vulnerable, all rolls targeting you have advantage. CLEARING CONDITIONS When an effect imposes a condition, it might say it is “temporary,” or only applies \"temporarily,\" the condition is a temporary condition. You can make an action roll, with a Difficulty determined by the GM, to try clearing a temporary condition, though the GM might have you clear it in another way. As always, this action roll should be described and negotiated narratively. For example, if your character is Vulnerable, you might describe how you leap through the fire that’s trapped you, free your legs from the vines entangling them, or use a canteen to wash noxious venom off your body. If an adversary is affected by a temporary condition, the GM can use their move to spotlight the adversary and show how they clear the condition. This doesn’t require a roll but does use that adversary’s spotlight. When it fits the story, the GM might clear the condition in other ways instead. Special conditions are cleared only when specific requirements are met, such as completing a certain action or using an item. The requirements for clearing these conditions are stated in the text when the condition is applied. The GM can offer alternative ways to clear these conditions at their discretion. ENDING OTHER TEMPORARY EFFECTS Some effects aren’t a condition, but state that they are temporary. They can be ended in the same way as temporary conditions. If you initiate the effect (for example, by using the “Ranger’s Focus” class feature), the GM can end it by spotlighting the adversary and describing how they get rid of it. Conversely, if the GM initiates the effect (such as an adversary creating a temporary cloud of poisonous gas), you can try to end it by making an appropriate action roll. COUNTDOWNS Sometimes the GM, or a specific mechanic, utilizes a countdown. Countdowns are a way for the table to keep track of a coming event, which you do by setting a die to a certain value, then ticking that number down until it reaches 0. A countdown might tick down every time an action roll is made, every time a PC rolls with Fear, during each downtime, or any other parameter (either set by the specific mechanics or by the GM to reflect the fiction). To learn more about countdowns, see the “Countdowns” section on page 162. 102 Chapter 2: Core Mechanics"

The following section assumes you are using a map for combat. MAPS Your group might want to use maps to clarify positioning, showcase an environment, or simply because you enjoy maps and miniatures. Maps can be as elaborate or as simple as you like. When it’s time to use an area map, everyone places their miniatures on it. Use the range measurements discussed below as general reference when building out a map. RANGE Daggerheart measures most distance by range. Each range includes an example of how you might quickly estimate distance on a physical map on which 1 inch represents roughly 5 feet. However, these ranges aren’t intended to be precisely measured during play. The suggested estimates are a quick guide for the GM to determine ranges during a scene, and they might adjust the map as needed. The map should always adjust to capture the fiction, rather than the fiction changing to match the map. If the table decides not to implement a map, you still use range, but in a more abstract way. Distances are simply a part of the theater of the mind, and it’s up to the GM to decide roughly how far away everything is. Melee: Your character is within touching distance of the target. A PC can touch targets up to a few feet away from them. Keep in mind that Melee range might be greater for especially large NPCs. Very Close: Your character is very close to a target, able to see their fine details, and can reach them within moments. This is about 5–10 feet away. While in danger, a character can move into Melee range with anything that’s within Very Close range of them as part of their action. Anything on a battle map that is within the shortest length of a game card (2–3 inches) can usually be considered within Very Close range. Close: Your character is close enough to a target to see their prominent details, such as across a room or in a neighboring market stall. This is about 10–30 feet away. While in danger, a character can move into Melee range with anything that’s within Close range of them as part of their action. Anything on a battle map that is within the length of a standard pen or pencil (5–6 inches) can usually be considered within Close range. Far: Your character is far enough away that they can see the appearance of a target, but not in detail, such as across a small battlefield or down a large corridor. This is about 30–100 feet away. While a character is in danger, the GM might call for them to make an Agility Roll to safely move into Melee range with something that’s within Far range of them. Anything on a battle map that is within the length of the long edge of a standard piece of paper (11–12 inches) can usually be considered within Far range. Very Far: Your character is very far away, such as across a large battlefield or down a long street, and while they might be able to see the shape of a person or object, they likely can’t make out any details. This is about 100–300 feet away. While a character is in danger, the GM might call for them to make an Agility Roll to safely move into Melee range with something that’s within Very Far range of them. Anything on a battle map that is beyond Far range, but still within the bounds of the conflict or scene, can usually be considered within Very Far range. Out of Range: Anything beyond a character’s Very Far range is Out of Range and usually can’t be targeted. Tip: When specific distances are referenced in the game (such as a wall that is 30 feet high or a rope that is 50 feet long) it is to give a sense of scale in the fiction. In this same way, you shouldn't feel restricted to using ranges when describing the world—just when the characters interact with it mechanically. USING RANGE When a weapon, spell, ability, item, or other effect states a range, this refers to its maximum range. Unless otherwise noted, an effect can also be used at closer ranges. For example, the shortstaff weapon has a Close range, so it can be used against a target within Close, Very Close, or Melee range. Range is always measured from the source of the effect (often the attacker or caster), unless the feature says otherwise. This means targets in any direction of your character within the specified range can be hit. Some effects specify a certain area within their range, such as an effect that targets “all adversaries in front of you.” In that example, you choose which direction your character is facing, then target each adversary in a 180-degree field in front of them. If an effect targets creatures in a line, then you target each adversary in a straight line within the specified range. As with other rules in this game, use common sense when interpreting these effects—they’re there to support the story, not limit it. Other effects can move your character or a target from one range to another, such as an effect that lets you “knock back a target to Close range.” These effects typically clarify which range band a target is moved to (you can always move them closer by choice). But if the fiction doesn’t support it—for example, if an adversary hits a wall and can’t be moved any farther—then follow the fiction rather than the exact range. A map is just an approximation of the scene playing out in everyone’s head, so scale, distance, and details don’t need to be perfectly accurate. The map and the miniatures on it should never limit the table’s imagination, only provide spatial context so everyone is on the same page. OPTIONAL RULE: DEFINED RANGES If your table would rather operate with more precise range rules, you can use a 1-inch grid battle map during combat. If you do, use the following guidelines for play: • Melee: 1 square • Very Close: 3 squares • Close: 6 squares • Far: 12 squares • Very Far: 13+ squares • Out of Range: Off the battlemap 103 Chapter 2: Core Mechanics"

However, when you’re under pressure or in danger, the following rules apply. MOVING CLOSE DURING ACTIONS When you make an action roll, you can also move to a location within Close range as part of that action. This location must be somewhere your character could plausibly and easily reach within the narrative. If you want to move somewhere beyond your Close range but within Far or Very Far range, or if you want to reach an area that’s not easily accessible (such as one that requires climbing, swimming, or jumping), use the following rules. MOVING FAR OR MOVING AS YOUR PRIMARY ACTION If you’re not already making an action roll, or if you want to move farther than your Close range, you’ll need to succeed on an Agility Roll to safely reposition yourself. The GM sets this Difficulty depending on the situation. On a failure, you might only be able to move some of that distance, the adversaries might act before you can make it, or a hazard might prevent you from moving at all. ADVERSARY MOVEMENT When an adversary is in the spotlight and makes a move such as attacking a target or picking a lock, the GM can move them within their Close range as part of their action. For example, the adversary can pick a lock to open a door and then move within their Close range toward a PC inside the room beyond. If the GM wants to move the adversary somewhere beyond their Close range but within their Far or Very Far range, this uses their entire action, but the adversary doesn’t have to succeed on an Agility Roll like a PC would. TARGETS AND GROUPS An effect often asks you to choose a target within range. This means you choose a single creature to affect. When it makes sense in the story, you can ask the GM if you can target a single object in range, rather than an adversary, adjusting the effects as needed. If an effect allows for multiple targets, you can choose any that fall within the parameters of the effect. To affect a group of targets, those targets must be clumped together in an area within Very Close range of a point you choose. You can always ask the GM if adversaries would be considered a group before you make a move. Regardless of the number of targets, you only make one attack roll and compare its result to the Difficulty of each eligible target to determine which creatures you succeed against. When your attack deals damage to more than one target, roll damage once and apply the total to each target the attack succeeded against. COVER, LINE OF SIGHT, AND DARKNESS Sometimes during a fight, you might seek cover, such as by diving behind a small barricade or ducking behind a tree. When you take cover behind something that makes attacking you more difficult (but not impossible), attack rolls against you are made with disadvantage. You usually can’t be targeted if you’re entirely behind a substantial structure like a wall, even if you’re technically in range of the attack. However, you might still be affected by nearby explosions or similar effects that target an area. Some effects require the target to be within your line of sight. You have line of sight if you can see the target (though in some situations, the GM might decide the effect can’t go through a glass window or similarly transparent object). For alternatives to this rule for blind characters, see the “Adjusting Abilities and Spells” section on page 82. Darkness can also make certain actions more challenging. The GM should reflect this by raising the Difficulty of action rolls or imposing disadvantage on rolls made by the PCs. GOLD Gold tracks how much wealth you have collected on your journey. You can spend it on things such as items, consumables, and equipment. Some campaigns are more or less focused on gold as a reward, so check with your GM about how much your game will prioritize gold. There are no set prices in this book for weapons, armor, and loot, so you aren’t locked out of adding exciting equipment if you’re not playing a gold-focused campaign. The GM determines equipment prices based on the amount of gold given out during your sessions. Gold is measured in handfuls, bags, and chests, with 10 handfuls to 1 bag, and 10 bags to 1 chest. When you have marked all of the slots in a category and you gain another gold reward in that category, you mark a slot in the following category and clear all the slots in the current one. For example, if you have 9 handfuls and gain another, you instead mark 1 bag and erase all handfuls. If you have 9 bags and gain another, you mark 1 chest and erase all bags. If you ever have more than 1 chest, you’ll need to store some of your gold before you can take more. The value of gold is abstracted so you don’t need to track it precisely. If you want to tip a coin to a waiter or flip a coin into a well, you don’t need to worry about it. OPTIONAL RULE: GOLD COINS If your group wants to track gold more granularly, you can add coins as your lowest denomination. Following the established pattern, 10 coins equal 1 handful. 104 Chapter 2: Core Mechanics"

Though downtime is their chance to recover from the dangers they’ve faced, it’s also an opportunity for characters to have important, emotional scenes with each other—to learn more about one another in their quiet moments together and have character-centric conversations they might not have had time for during big battles or high-intensity exploits. When the characters decide they want to have downtime, they choose between a short rest and a long rest. A party can take up to three short rests before their next rest must be a long rest. If a short rest is interrupted (such as by an adversary's attack), characters don’t gain its benefits. If a long rest is interrupted, the characters instead gain the benefits of a short rest (even if they’ve already had three short rests). SHORT REST A short rest is when the characters stop to catch their breath, taking a break for about an hour. Each player can swap any domain cards in their loadout for cards in their vault, then choose two of the following moves (or choose the same move twice). Some short rest downtime moves require you to use your tier as a value. This is covered in the upcoming “Tiers of Play” section. Tend to Wounds: Describe how you hastily patch yourself up, then clear a number of Hit Points equal to 1d4 + your tier. You can do this to an ally instead. Clear Stress: Describe how you blow off steam or pull yourself together, then clear a number of Stress equal to 1d4 + your tier. Repair Armor: Describe how you quickly repair your armor, then clear a number of Armor Slots equal to 1d4 + your tier. You can do this to an ally’s armor instead. Prepare: Describe how you prepare yourself for the path ahead, then gain a Hope. If you choose to Prepare with one or more members of your party, you each gain 2 Hope. LONG REST A long rest is when the characters make camp, relax for a few hours, and get some rest. Each player can swap any domain cards in their loadout for cards in their vault, then can choose two of the following moves (or choose the same move twice). Tend to All Wounds: Describe how you patch yourself up, then clear all Hit Points. You can do this to an ally instead. Clear All Stress: Describe how you blow off steam or pull yourself together, then clear all Stress. Repair All Armor: Describe how you spend time repairing your armor, then clear all Armor Slots. You can do this to an ally’s armor instead. Prepare: Describe how you prepare for the next day’s adventure, then gain a Hope. If you choose to Prepare with one or more members of your party, you each gain 2 Hope. Work on a Project: Establish or continue work on a project (see the following “Working on a Project in Downtime” section). WORKING ON A PROJECT IN DOWNTIME If a PC wants to pursue a project that would take them a substantial amount of time but that they can work on during a long rest, they should first discuss it with the GM. This could involve deciphering an ancient text, crafting a new weapon, or something similar. Projects usually involve a Progress Countdown (see the “Countdowns” section on page 162). Each time a PC takes the Work on a Project downtime move during a long rest, they either automatically tick down their countdown, or the GM might ask them to make an action roll to gauge their progress. For more information on projects, see the “Using Downtime” section on page 181. DOWNTIME CONSEQUENCES Downtime allows for quiet scenes between characters, encouraging personal moments in the story—but the world doesn’t stop when you rest! The GM also takes actions during downtime. On a short rest, they gain 1d4 Fear. On a long rest, they gain an amount of Fear equal to 1d4 + the number of PCs, and they can advance a long-term countdown. REFRESHING FEATURES DURING DOWNTIME Resting can refresh the availability of your features and end some temporary effects. • Any effects that last until your next rest end when your character finishes either a long or a short rest. Likewise, any features that can be used a number of times per rest refresh when your character finishes either a long or a short rest. • Any effects that last until your next long rest end when your character finishes a long rest. Likewise, any features that can be used a number of times per long rest only refresh when your character finishes a long rest. ONCE PER SESSION FEATURES Some features say you can use them “once per session.” These features don’t refresh during rests, but instead are available again at the start of your next Daggerheart session. If your table decides to play a long session, the GM might decide that all “once per session” abilities are refreshed during a break in play instead. 105 Chapter 2: Core Mechanics"

In Daggerheart, when you mark your last Hit Point, you must make a death move. DEATH MOVE Choose one of the following options: Blaze of Glory: Your character embraces death and goes out in a blaze of glory. Take one action (at the GM’s discretion), which critically succeeds, then cross through the veil of death. Avoid Death: Your character avoids death and faces the consequences. They temporarily drop unconscious, and then you work with the GM to describe how the situation worsens. Your character can’t move or act while unconscious, they can’t be targeted by an attack, and they return to consciousness when an ally clears 1 or more of their marked Hit Points or when the party finishes a long rest. After your character falls unconscious, roll your Hope Die. If its value is equal to or under your character’s level, they gain a scar (see the following “Scars” section). Risk It All: Roll your Duality Dice. If the Hope Die is higher, your character stays on their feet and clears an amount of Hit Points or Stress equal to the value of the Hope Die (divide the Hope Die value between Hit Points and Stress however you’d prefer). If the Fear Die is higher, your character crosses through the veil of death. If you critically succeed, your character stays up and clears all Hit Points and Stress. If a player makes a death move that results in their character dying, they should work with the GM before the next session to build a new character at the current level of the rest of the party. SCARS If you choose to avoid death, you might take a scar. If you do, cross out one of your Hope slots. You can’t use this slot anymore. The narrative impact of this scar is up to you. For example, you might now bear a physical scar, a painful memory, or a deep fear. Scars are permanent, but can be healed at the GM's discretion as a downtime project, a reward for a quest focused on healing that scar, or something with similar narrative weight. If you ever cross out your last Hope slot, it’s time to end your character’s journey. Work with the GM to find a fitting way for the party to say goodbye to them at the end of the session, then prepare a new character at the current level of the rest of the party for the next time you play. RESURRECTION It is possible to resurrect a dead character, though it’s often a long, difficult, and costly process. If a party decides to take this path upon a character’s death, the GM details the steps the party must take to complete the resurrection.

ROUNDING UP This game doesn’t use fractions; if you need to round to a whole number, round up unless otherwise specified. REROLLING DICE When a feature allows you to reroll a die, you always take the new result. You do not choose between the first result and the new one, unless the feature specifically says that you can. INCOMING DAMAGE When a feature refers to incoming damage, it’s describing the damage amount a target is currently receiving. For example, the dwarves' “Increased Fortitude” feature allows a PC to spend 3 Hope to halve incoming physical damage. This means that the GM tells the player how much damage their PC is taking from an attack. The player can then decide to spend 3 Hope to take half as much damage instead. If the player wanted to do this again on an additional attack, they’d need to spend another 3 Hope. SIMULTANEOUS AND STACKING EFFECTS If two or more effects can apply to a situation, and the rules don’t tell you which order to apply them in, the player controlling the effects (including the GM) can apply the effects in any order. For example, if one ability lets you spend a Hope to retaliate after an attack, and another ability lets you gain a Hope when you mark a Hit Point, you can decide to gain the Hope first, then spend it to make the attack. Similarly, if you have multiple moves that can trigger in a situation (such as two moves that occur “after a successful attack”), you can use them together and choose in which order to activate them. If you want to apply two or more effects, they must both be able to successfully resolve to be used together. Otherwise, you must choose which one applies. For example, if you can clear a Stress every time you roll with Fear, and you have an ability that lets you make a roll with Fear into a roll with Hope, you can’t clear a Stress and then change the roll to be with Hope instead of Fear. As always, if there’s any uncertainty, the GM arbitrates how effects apply. At the GM’s discretion, most effects can stack. For example, if two bards give you a Rally Die, you can spend both of them on the same roll. However, you can’t stack conditions, advantage or disadvantage, or other effects that say you can’t. ONGOING SPELL EFFECTS Once a spell's effect is in play, as long as it doesn’t mention an expiration, it continues until a PC or the GM ends it, or until the fiction changes in a way that would naturally stop it. This means that if you cast a spell and then switch out that domain card for another in your vault, the spell’s effect can remain active, even though that card is no longer in your loadout. SPENDING RESOURCES If a rule tells you to spend a resource, you lose that resource once you spend it. For example, when you spend a Hope on an ability, you clear a Hope that you’ve marked on your character sheet. Similarly, if a bard gives you a Rally Die, when you choose to spend it and add its result to your roll, you lose that die and return it to the other player. Unless an effect states otherwise, you can’t spend Hope or mark Stress multiple times on the same feature to increase or repeat its effects on the same roll. For example, if a feature says you can “spend a Hope to add 1d6 to the damage roll,” you can’t spend 2 Hope and add 2d6 instead. If a feature says “mark a Stress to gain a +3 bonus to your Spellcast Roll,” you can’t mark 2 Stress and gain a +6 bonus. However, on an effect like the Guardian’s Hope Feature, which says “Spend 3 Hope to clear 2 Armor Slots,” you can spend 6 Hope to clear 4 Armor Slots, because this effect isn’t applying its bonus to a specific roll—you’re just activating the feature more than once. USING FEATURES AFTER A ROLL Some features let you affect a roll after the result has been totaled—such as the seraph’s “Prayer Dice,” the faerie’s “Wings,” or the Grace domain’s “Endless Charisma.” In this case, you use it after the GM declares if the roll succeeds or fails, but before the narrative consequences unfold (such as damage being rolled) or another dice roll is made. END OF THE SCENE Sometimes certain effects, bonuses, or conditions state that they last until the end of the scene. At the GM’s discretion, a scene continues until the current narrative situation has played out. A chase scene might end when the PCs have caught their quarry or when they’ve escaped pursuit. A battle scene usually ends when one side has fled, surrendered, or been entirely defeated. If there’s uncertainty about when a scene is considered to be over, throw it to the table and see what the players think makes sense. You don’t have to linger in a scene after the most engaging actions and interactions have occurred. If you want to play out their implications or process the emotions but the heat of the moment has passed, that aftermath can take place in its own scene. 107 Chapter 2: Additional Rules"

When considering these best practices, remember the “Player Principles” section in this book’s introduction. EMBRACE DANGER The life of an adventurer is a dangerous one, often filled with treacherous paths, monstrous threats, and powerful foes. Along the way, you’ll face difficult choices and life-threatening peril. It’s important as adventurers to embrace this danger as part of the game. Playing it safe, not taking risks, and overthinking a plan can often slow the game to a halt. Don’t be afraid to leap in headfirst and think like a storyteller, asking what the hero of a novel or a TV show would do here? Think about not only what choice might be obvious, but what story could be most interesting, or how your character might approach the situation differently because of their background. Remember that you are not your character and that it’s okay to put them into harm’s way, push them to their limits, and take big risks if it’s right for the story. Their trials and their failures are not yours. We might always want to win, but players win by collaborating on a compelling narrative, not by having successful dice rolls every time. USE YOUR RESOURCES Player characters in Daggerheart have access to many resources that help them in their heroic journey. Chief among them is Hope, a resource that frequently comes and goes over the course of a session. You’ll gain a Hope roughly every other time you make an action roll, so you’re encouraged to spend it on Hope Features, to Help an Ally, to Utilize an Experience, to initiate a Tag Team Roll, and to use other features and abilities that cost Hope. Stress, Hit Points, and Armor are your most essential other resources. They interact in varying ways that you can manipulate and optimize with domain abilities, ancestry features, class features, and more. For players excited about the crunch of interacting mechanics, look to those resources and think about how to manage them to get the most out of your character. TELL THE STORY You are an equal partner in telling the story alongside everyone else at the table. The GM presents opportunities and challenges for the party along the way, but they are not the sole author of the fiction you’re exploring together. Daggerheart is a collaborative game where everyone is responsible for bringing the tone, feel, and themes they’re interested in to the group. If you have an idea for a description or a detail to add, feel free to offer it to the table. If you want a specific emotional arc to be a part of your story, talk to your GM about finding opportunities to include it, and seize those opportunities when they show up. When you reach these moments in the story, take the time to showcase the emotions driving your character forward and the desires spurring their actions. Your role as a player in Daggerheart is to guide your character along the best story arc you can, not necessarily to always make the most tactical or strategic moves. Think about what you’re interested in saying thematically with the narrative, and let that be expressed through your character. DISCOVER YOUR CHARACTER It’s okay not to know everything about your character when you sit down to play for the first time, the tenth time, or even the hundredth time. When the game begins, you only have a few pieces of information to go on—such as what your character might be good at, some backstory, their relationships with a few other characters, and what kind of weapon they carry. That’s perfectly fine—because you’ll build on your character throughout the game. Think of character creation as an ongoing process. The GM might turn to you to ask something about your past that you haven't worked out or thought of yet. You could take this opportunity to invent something on the spot, or ask them to talk through some ideas with you before you settle on one.

How often this happens is up to your GM and your group’s narrative preferences, but most groups play at least three sessions between levels. OVERVIEW All party members level up at the same time. When you level up your character, you can upgrade their character traits and features. The following sections provide step-by-step instructions for leveling up a character. Generally, characters begin their journey at level 1 and end their journey at level 10, but if a party loses a character in the middle of a campaign, the GM should have the character's player make a new character at the appropriate level of the party. TIERS OF PLAY Levels in Daggerheart are divided into tiers. → Tier 1 encompasses level 1 only. → Tier 2 encompasses levels 2–4. → Tier 3 encompasses levels 5–7. → Tier 4 encompasses levels 8–10. Your tier affects your damage thresholds, level achievements, and more. LEVEL ACHIEVEMENTS When your character levels up, first take any level achievements they have earned. These achievements are given in at the top of the tier block, found on the lower half of your class guide. • At level 2, you gain an additional Experience and add it to your character sheet with a modifier of +2. You also gain a permanent +1 bonus to your Proficiency. • At level 5, you gain an additional Experience and add it to your character sheet with a modifier of +2. You also gain a permanent +1 bonus to your Proficiency. You clear any marks on each character trait you’ve previously increased and marked, allowing you to increase those traits again later. • At level 8, you gain an additional Experience and add it to your character sheet with a modifier of +2. You also gain a permanent +1 bonus to your Proficiency. You clear any marks on each character trait you’ve previously increased and marked.

You can’t increase these stats again until the next tier (when your level achievement allows you to clear those marks). • When you choose to permanently add 1 or more Hit Point slots: Darken the outline of the next rectangle in the Hit Point section of your character sheet in pen or permanent marker. • When you choose to permanently add 1 or more Stress slots: Darken the outline of the next rectangle in the Stress section of your character sheet in pen or permanent marker. • When you choose to increase an Experience: Choose an Experience on your character sheet and gain a permanent +1 bonus to it. • Take an additional domain card of your level or lower from a domain you have access to: You can choose an additional domain card from your class’s domains at your level or lower. If you have multiclassed, select a card from your chosen domain at no higher than half your level. • When you choose to increase your Evasion: Gain a permanent +1 bonus to your Evasion. • When you choose to take an upgraded subclass card: Take the next card for your subclass. If you have only the foundation card, take a specialization. If you have a specialization already, take a mastery. You’ll also cross out the option to multiclass when you subsequently level up in that tier. • When you choose to increase your Proficiency: Fill in one of the open circles in the “Proficiency” section of your character sheet, then increase your weapon’s number of damage dice by 1 (for example, from 2d6 to 3d6). You’ll see a black box around the level-up slots. That is because increasing your Proficiency requires you to mark both level-up slots in order to take it as an option. • When you choose to multiclass: You can take certain features and domain cards from another class. You’ll see a black box around the level-up slots. That is because multiclassing requires you to mark both level-up slots in order to take it as an option.

TAKING DOMAIN CARDS Finally, take a new domain deck card at your level or lower, increasing the special abilities your character can use. You can choose one card from any domain deck available to your class. If you share a domain deck with another player, make sure you take each other’s preferences into consideration when choosing a card, or that you have multiple copies of a card available. Additionally, you can also choose to trade out one domain card you already have for a different domain card of an equal level or lower. Since you can’t have more than five domain cards active at a time, once you have six or more domain cards, you need to choose which to keep in your loadout and which to store in your vault. MULTICLASSING Starting at level 5, you can choose multiclassing as an option when leveling up. When you multiclass, you get to choose an additional class, select one domain from that class, and gain access to their class feature. Take the appropriate multiclass module and add it to the right side of your character sheet, then choose a foundation card from a subclass of your choice. If that foundation card has a Spellcast trait on it, you can choose to use that trait when making a Spellcast Roll or use the Spellcast trait from your original subclass. If you did not previously have a Spellcast trait and now require one for your multiclass, you must use the Spellcast trait noted on your new subclass. Tip: When you multiclass, you must cross out one available “take an upgraded subclass card” option on this tier of your level up sheet, meaning you can’t gain the mastery card for any subclass. You also cross out any other multiclass options, as characters can only multiclass once. Choose a domain from your new class that you don’t already have access to. Moving forward, whenever you get to choose domain cards, you can choose from cards that match your additional domain at half your current level (rounded up). This means a level 5 wizard who decides to multiclass into druid and chooses the Sage domain could choose any Sage domain cards of level 3 or lower. Any attacks, spells, or other moves you use while multiclassing are always performed at your current level. For example, a level 7 wizard who multiclasses into a druid can use the tier 3 “Beastform” options. If any move you get by multiclassing asks you to use a number of dice equal to your level, use the level on your character sheet. The half-level restriction only applies to selecting domain cards, not the mechanics written on them. EXAMPLE OF LEVELING UP A CHARACTER Aliyah’s party has just advanced to level 2 and the group is leveling up together. Aliyah finds the warrior class guide to bring Tabby up to level 2. • First, Aliyah updates Tabby’s level to “2” at the top of her character sheet. • Aliyah then takes her level achievements. She adds a new Experience for Tabby. Because Tabby has been doing a lot of acrobatics and daring jumps, she decides to give her the Always Land on My Feet Experience. This is a new Experience, so it starts with a +2 modifier. Afterward, she increases Tabby’s Proficiency to 2 (because she gets a permanent +1 bonus at level 2) and fills in one of the circles in the Proficiency section of her character sheet to reflect the change. • Next, she looks at the advancement options for levels 2 to 4. She knows she wants to increase Tabby’s Agility, since that’s her primary trait for combat. She marks “Gain a +1 bonus to two unmarked character traits and mark them.” Aliyah chooses Agility and Instinct, raising each by 1 (Tabby now has an Agility of +3 and an Instinct of +2), then marks the circle attached to each trait as a reminder that they can’t be raised again until Tabby hits level 5 and clears marks on all traits. • Following that, Aliyah marks “Permanently gain one Stress slot.” She looks at the Stress section of Tabby’s character sheet and fills in the outline of one of the dotted squares to represent Tabby’s new permanent Stress slot. That means she'll be able to withstand more strain during play. • She then goes to Tabby’s damage thresholds and gains a permanent +1 bonus to both from her level up, increasing her Major threshold from 7 to 8 and her Severe threshold from 14 to 15. Additionally, she updates the damage bonus from her “Combat Training” class feature to +2, as the bonus is equal to her level. • Lastly, Aliyah asks for the domain decks for Blade and Bone to pick a new domain card at level 2 or lower. At level 2, her options in the Blade deck are “Reckless” and “A Soldier’s Bond.” Her choices from the Bone are “Strategic Approach” and “Ferocity.” Aliyah considers the option to gain and give Hope with “A Soldier’s Bond.” Since Tabby’s Knowledge trait is only 0, she doesn't think “Strategic Approach” is a good choice. In the end, she settles on “Reckless” to give Tabby a better chance of hitting her opponents. Now Tabby is ready to continue her journey as a level 2 warrior! 111 Chapter 2: Leveling Up"

EQUIPPING, STORING, AND SWITCHING EQUIPMENT You equip weapons and armor to your character by recording them on your character sheet in the “Active Weapons” and “Active Armor” sections. Your character can only attack with weapons, benefit from armor, and gain features from items they have equipped. INVENTORY WEAPONS As your character acquires new equipment throughout their journey, they can carry two additional weapons (primary, secondary, or any combination of the two) in the “Inventory Weapon” areas of the character sheet, but there’s only so much room in your character’s pack. The inventory section holds gear your character doesn't have equipped, therefore your character isn't wielding these items and will not gain their benefits. SWITCHING WEAPONS When your character is in a dangerous situation, you can mark a Stress to equip an Inventory Weapon, moving their previous Active Weapon into the Inventory Weapon section. If your character is in a calm situation or preparing during a rest, they can swap weapons with no Stress cost. SWITCHING ARMOR Your character can’t equip armor while in danger or under pressure. Otherwise, they can equip armor freely, replacing their previous active armor with armor they’ve purchased or otherwise acquired. Each armor has its own Armor Slots, as recorded in the boxes in that section; if your character switches armor, be sure to keep track of how many Armor Slots you’ve marked on the old armor, especially if you are giving it to a party member. You can't carry additional armor in your inventory. When your character switches armor, be sure to add their current level to its base damage thresholds and incorporate any bonuses they might have from other features. USING WEAPONS The following sections detail the types of weapons found in Daggerheart, then break down their statistics. When you’re ready to review the weapon options, see the “Primary Weapon Tables” and “Secondary Weapon Tables” sections, which list available weapons by tier. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY WEAPONS Weapons fall into two main categories: primary and secondary. Primary weapons are the main weapons your character will likely be fighting with during an encounter. A character can only hold one primary weapon at a time, which goes into the “Primary Weapon” area of their character sheet. If you take a two-handed weapon, this is typically the only weapon your character can have active. The list of starting primary weapons, called Tier 1 primary weapons, can be found in the upcoming “Primary Weapon Tables” section on page 115. Secondary weapons are typically ancillary pieces of equipment that augment your character’s fighting, such as shields, daggers, or small swords. If a character's primary weapon is one-handed, we recommend you also take a secondary weapon (but you can’t hold your secondary weapon if you switch to a primary weapon that requires two hands). Your character can only hold one secondary weapon at a time, which goes in the “Secondary Weapon” area on their character sheet. The list of starting secondary weapons, called Tier 1 secondary weapons, can be found in the upcoming “Secondary Weapon Tables” section on page 124. You can make an attack roll with either a primary or secondary weapon your character has equipped, allowing for flexibility in the types of attacks you can make. Many secondary weapons have features that augment another aspect of your character’s fighting style—for example, a dagger might grant them extra damage to targets they attack with their primary weapon within Melee range, or a shield might add to your character’s Armor Score. Most adventurers choose to at least carry a primary weapon, but for guidance on fighting without a weapon, see the “Unarmed Attack Rolls” section on page 96. THROWING A WEAPON When you’re using a weapon that you could theoretically throw (such as a dagger or an axe), you can throw it at a target within Very Close range, making an attack roll using Finesse. On a success, deal damage as usual for that weapon. Once thrown, you lose that weapon. Unless you retrieve it, you can’t attack with it or benefit from its features. 112 Chapter 2: Equipment"

Unless you retrieve it, you can’t attack with it or benefit from its features. 112 Chapter 2: Equipment\n-- 113 of 415 --\nWEAPON STATISTICS Each weapon in this book includes its name, trait, range, damage die, damage type, and burden. Some weapons also have a feature. For example, the broadsword starting weapon has the following statistics: Name Trait Range Damage Burden Feature Broadsword Agility Melee d8 phy One-handed Reliable: +1 to attack rolls NAME In your character's early adventures, most weapon names are the same as their type. For starting weapons, this is often something straightforward, such as a battleaxe or hand runes. As characters level up and collect better equipment, this name could become more specific—something like a flaming dragonscale blade, a valiant bow, or even a named weapon like the Wand of Essek. TRAIT This tells you what trait is used when making an attack with this weapon. For example, a Strength weapon uses your character’s Strength trait whenever they use it to attack a target. RANGE Range signifies the maximum distance from which a weapon or effect can hit a target. You can hit something in Melee, Very Close, Close, Far, or Very Far range with an effect or weapon. DAMAGE The damage represents how deadly your weapon is against the adversaries you face. When a weapon’s damage lists a type of die—such as “d8”—you roll that die to determine the damage you deal. As your character levels up, they’ll increase their Proficiency, which starts at 1. Unless otherwise specified, you roll a number of damage dice equal to your character’s Proficiency. For example, if your character’s Proficiency is 2 and their damage die is a d8, you roll 2d8 and add their values together. If you roll a 4 and an 8 on these dice, you deal a total of 12 damage. DAMAGE TYPE A weapon’s damage type specifies what kind of damage it does to a target: physical (phy) or magic (mag). Physical damage comes from any wielded weapon that cuts, stabs, or bludgeons (such as swords, longbows, and warhammers). Magic damage is caused or enhanced by magic (such as the “Conjure Swarm,” “Midnight Spirit,” and “Smite” spells). Damage types are important because some creatures might have resistance or immunity to one of the two types. For example, ghosts may not be as affected by physical damage as they are by magic damage. You typically can’t wield weapons that deal magic damage unless you have a Spellcast trait. BURDEN A weapon’s burden notes how many hands it takes to wield it. Weapons are either one-handed or two-handed. When you take a weapon, you’ll also fill up a number of hands equal to its burden on your character sheet. If your character can’t bear the burden of a weapon because their hands are already full, you can’t equip it. You’re welcome to create a character with any number of hands or have your character wield a weapon using something other than their hands. However, when tracking burden, each character mechanically has two appendages capable of wielding weapons. FEATURE A weapon feature describes any special rules that apply only to that particular weapon. For example, some features reduce or increase your character’s statistics, while others give them special ways to deal damage. A weapon’s features only apply to that weapon; you can’t apply its features to a different weapon. Your character can only benefit from a weapon's features while the weapon is equipped. If you put a weapon into your inventory, lose it, or get rid of it, your character no longer gains the benefits of that feature. Arrows & Ammunition We assume that if your character has a bow, they’re well supplied with standard arrows. If you have a gun, they're well supplied with standard bullets of the applicable type. But if they've picked up specialized ammunition at some point, be prepared to keep track of this limited arsenal. Tip: Your party might want to play a campaign that feels grounded or gritty. If so, you can monitor and limit the acquisition of supplies such as food, ammunition, and other sundries. Have a discussion with your GM and table about the cost of goods and the availability of materials in your world. 113 Chapter 2: Equipment"

Some armor also has a feature. For example, the chainmail starting armor has the following statistics: Name Base Thresholds Base Score Feature Chainmail Armor 7 / 15 4 Heavy: −1 to Evasion NAME In your character's early adventures, most early armor names are the same as their type, such as chainmail armor. As your character levels up, they might acquire special armor, such as veritas opal armor. BASE SCORE An armor’s base score represents the short-term protection it provides and how many Armor Slots you can mark (before any bonuses from other features). For example, if an armor’s base score is 4, you have 4 available Armor Slots you can mark. Your character’s Armor Score, with all bonuses included, can never exceed 12. Once you add all other bonuses to an armor’s base score, the final total is referred to as your character’s Armor Score. BASE THRESHOLDS An armor’s base damage thresholds represent the long-term protection your armor provides, and determine your damage thresholds (before any bonuses from other features). When recording your character’s damage thresholds in the “Damage & Health” section of your character sheet, you always add your character’s level to those values. For example, if your level 1 character has base thresholds of 7/15 with no other bonuses, they would have a Major damage threshold of 8 and a Severe damage threshold of 16. FEATURE Armor features describe any special rules that apply only to that particular armor. For example, some reduce or increase your character’s statistics, and others give you special ways to use your character’s Armor Slots. A set of armor's features apply only to that specific armor; you can’t apply its features to different armor. Your character can benefit from a set of armor's features only while armor is equipped. REDUCING DAMAGE When your character takes damage, you can negate some (or all) of it by marking an available Armor Slot next to the large Armor shield on your character sheet, then reducing the severity of the damage by one threshold (Severe to Major, Major to Minor, Minor to Nothing). Each time your character takes damage, you can only mark 1 Armor Slot (as long as you have one available). Once all available Armor Slots are marked, your character’s armor can’t be used again in this way until they repair it, usually as a move during downtime. Example: Rune has an Armor Score of 3 and Miles, his player, has marked 1 Armor Slot already. If an adversary hits Rune for Major damage, Miles can mark an Armor Slot to reduce that to Minor instead. That puts him at 2 marked Armor Slots, so he can only mark 1 more Armor Slot before needing to repair his armor during downtime. If your character has an Armor Score of 0, you can’t mark Armor Slots. If an effect gives your character a temporary Armor Score (such as the “Tava’s Armor” spell), you can mark that many additional Armor Slots while the temporary armor is active. When the temporary armor ends, clear a number of Armor Slots equal to the temporary Armor Score. Example: Miles’s wizard Rune gains a +2 bonus to his Armor Score until his next rest. Miles changes Rune’s Armor Score to 5. At the start of his next short rest, he changes Rune’s Armor Score back to 3 and clears 2 Armor Slots. UNARMORED Going unarmored does not give your character any bonuses or penalties, but while unarmored, they have an Armor Score of 0, their Major threshold is equal to their level, and their Severe threshold is equal to twice their level. REFLAVORING ARMOR As with weapons, class abilities, and domains, you can reflavor your character’s armor to suit them. A wizard using full plate armor might describe their protection as coming from heavily enchanted robes and protective rings, while their penalty to Evasion and Agility is due to the intense focus required to maintain such powerful protective magic. armor 3 X X Armor Score of 3 with 2 Armor Slots marked. 114 Chapter 2: Equipment"

FLOATING BLADE SHARDS MAGUS REVOLVERWAND OF ESSEK SWORD OF LIGHT & FLAME BLOODSTAFF 121 Chapter 2: Primary Weapon Tables\n-- 122 of 415 --\nCOMBAT WHEELCHAIR By Mark Thompson The combat wheelchair is a ruleset designed to help you play a wheelchair user in Daggerheart. This section provides mechanics and narrative guidance for you to work from, but feel free to adapt the flavor text to best suit your character. Have fun with your character’s wheelchair design, and make it as unique or tailored to them as you please. ACTION AND MOVEMENT When describing how your character moves, you can use descriptions such as the following: • “I roll over to the door to see if it’s open.” • “I wheel myself over to the group to ask what’s going on.” • “I pull my brakes and skid to a halt, turning in my seat to level my bow at the intruder.” CONSEQUENCES Here are some ways you might describe complications you encounter when your character uses their wheelchair: • “I pull my brakes, but I don’t think to account for the loose gravel on the ground.” • “I hit a patch of ice awkwardly and am sent skidding out past my target.” • “I go to push off in pursuit, but one of my front caster wheels snags on a crack in the pavement, stalling me for a moment.” GMs should avoid breaking a character's wheelchair or otherwise removing it from play as a consequence, unless everyone at the table, especially the wheelchair user’s player, gives their approval. EVASION Your character is assumed to be skilled in moving their wheelchair and navigating numerous situations in it. As a result, the only wheelchair that gives a penalty to a PC's Evasion is the Heavy Frame model. BURDEN All wheelchairs can be maneuvered using one or two hands outside of combat. However, when being used as a weapon, the chair is restricted to requiring one or two hands to perform attacks, depending on the model you’ve chosen. If you’re playing a character who has limited to no mobility in their arms, their wheelchair can be attuned to them by magical means. For example, your character might use a psychic link to guide the chair around like a pseudo-electric wheelchair. All the rules presented here can be tailored and adapted to any character's needs. CHOOSING YOUR MODEL All combat wheelchairs are equipped as Primary Weapons. There are three models of wheelchair available: light, heavy, and arcane. You’re encouraged to consider the type of character you’re playing and the class they belong to, then choose the model that best matches that character concept. 122 Chapter 2: Primary Weapon Tables"

Unlike other primary magic weapons, the arcane-frame model doesn’t specify a trait to use when making an attack with it. Instead, you use the Spellcast trait indicated by your subclass.

The GM can pull loot from the following tables, or use the tables as inspiration to create their own unique loot. ITEMS Items are loot that can be kept and used repeatedly until you choose to get rid of them, or until something in the narrative causes you to lose them. Use the rolling guide on the right to generate items ahead of a game or during a session. Determine the desired rarity of your items, roll the associated number of d12s, add their values together (if needed), and take the item that matches that value. The rolling guide to the right also describes where each rarity of item is commonly found. • Common (1d12 or 2d12): Common items might be found at an abandoned camp or readily available at a local shop. • Uncommon (2d12 or 3d12): Uncommon items might be found in limited supply in a shop, kept in a protected place in a camp, or offered as part of a reward for a job. • Rare (3d12 or 4d12): Rare items might be kept under lock and key in a shop, offered as the sole reward for a job, or discovered among a powerful NPC’s possessions. • Legendary (4d12 or 5d12): Legendary items might be the only item of their kind, a reward for an incredibly difficult or dangerous job, or a powerful adversary’s most precious and guarded treasure.

For example, if you’re on the battlefield preparing to run at an adversary and attack them, you have a moment to drink a Stamina Potion before you sprint toward them. But if you’re pinned in the jaws of a massive Flickerfly and want to consume a Health Potion, the GM might rule that you need to make an action roll to drink it.

THE PARTY: • Quinn (they/them), playing Shepherd (they/them), Wildborne Infernis Warden of Renewal Druid • Miles (he/him), playing Rune (he/him), Ridgeborne Drakona School of War Wizard • Aliyah (she/her), playing Tabby (she/her), Underborne Katari Call of the Brave Warrior • Nolan (he/him), playing Lavelle (he/him), Slyborne Human Nightwalker Rogue THEIR GM: • Stella (she/her), who starts the scene with five Fear. STELLA: “Whitecrest Tower is built into the side of a mountain, forcing attackers approaching from the valley below to make a dangerous climb. So my first question is—how do you want to get up to the tower?” QUINN: “I want to use ‘Nature’s Tongue’ and find a goat or ram or some other creature that lives on the mountains and ask them about the easiest way up to the tower.” STELLA: “Absolutely. It’s not hard to find some goats tromping around in seeming defiance of gravity. Give me that Instinct Roll, Difficulty 12.” Quinn rolls the Duality Dice and adds 2 tokens to represent their Instinct of +2. They roll a 7 on the Hope Die and a 4 on the Fear Die. With their 2 tokens, the final result is a 13 with Hope. Quinn adds a Hope to their sheet. “On a success with Hope, the goat is friendly enough and gives you clear information. She remembers the pathway that the last group of two-legs took and leads you to it. Don’t forget to gain a Hope.” QUINN: “I respond, ‘Thank you, goat friend.’ Then I fish out some food from my pack and give it to her as she leads us up.” STELLA:“The food disappears in an instant. Then the goat starts scaling the mountain, leading you to the path. We’re going to do the ascent as a progress countdown, but since you’re getting help, I’m going to set it at 3 instead of 5. What’s the next move you make to scale the mountain?” ALIYAH: “Tabby is going to take the lead and set pitons for the others to help make the ascent easier for everyone.” STELLA: “That sounds like an Agility Roll.” Aliyah rolls a 2 on the Hope Die, but a 7 on the Fear Die. With Tabby’s Agility of +3, that’s a total of 12 with Fear. ALIYAH: “I’m going to use my ‘Feline Instincts’ as a katari to spend 2 Hope and reroll my Hope Die.\" She spends the Hope and rolls the Hope Die again, getting an 8. “Nice! That’s an 18 with Hope.” STELLA: “On a success with Hope, you tick down the countdown by 2.” “It’s down to 1, so at this point, even a success with Fear will get you to the tower. Gain a Hope. Tabby scales the mountain, neck and neck with the goat, setting pitons and throwing rope down behind to help the others. You’re making quick work, but there’s still another hundred feet between you and the top of the tower. What do you do?” MILES: “Oh, I want to try out my new grimoire. Rune takes some rope and pitons, and then he’s going to cast ‘Arcane Door’ to teleport up to the front gate so he can throw down the rope.” STELLA: “Nice. That’s a Spellcast Roll with Difficulty 13, and you spend a Hope to cast it.” Miles spends a Hope and rolls the Duality Dice, adding 3 modifier tokens for his character’s Spellcast trait (Knowledge). He gets a 5 on the Hope Die and a 6 on the Fear Die. MILES (slightly nervous): “That’s a 14, so a success…with Fear.” Stella gains a Fear, adding it to her pool. STELLA: “You all see Rune disappear and then reappear halfway up the remaining distance, then he blinks out again and appears by the front gate. With a rope leading all the way up, it’s relatively simple for the rest of you to make the climb unscathed.” QUINN: “I give the helpful goat another nibble of food before I send her off to her own business.” STELLA (nods): “Shepherd says farewell to the goat. But Rune, behind you something shifts, like the wooden floors of an old house. But this doesn’t feel like settling. It feels like something waking from slumber.” NOLAN (with an expression that suggests the opposite): “I’m sure that’s fine.” STELLA: “Once you’ve all made it up the rope, you stand at the shattered front gate of Whitecrest Tower, the mountainside wall collapsed and long since worn down by snow, rain, or avalanche. The only sounds you hear are the whistling of wind through the ruins as you pass the outer wall of Whitecrest Tower.” 134 Chapter 2: Full Example of Play"

Let’s sneak in as far as we can before we catch the attention of whatever’s already here.” STELLA: “Okay, that’ll be a group Finesse Roll.” QUINN: “Lavelle, you lead?” Nolan agrees, so Quinn, Miles, and Aliyah make Finesse Reaction Rolls for their characters. Miles and Quinn succeed, and Aliyah fails. STELLA: “Miles and Quinn, you each add a +1 to the group roll, and Aliyah adds a −1 for that failure, which means you’re at a +1, Nolan. Let’s see how you do in leading the group.” NOLAN: “I’m going to spend a Hope to Utilize an Experience, this is definitely the kind of intrusion Lavelle has done as a ‘Treasure Hunter.’” Nolan rolls a 2 on the Hope Die and a 4 on the Fear Die— that’s 6. He adds +3 for his Finesse, +2 for the “Treasure Hunter” Experience, and +1 from the party’s contribution (6+3+2+1=12). “That’s a total of 12, with Fear.” Stella grimaces as she takes a Fear token. STELLA: “A 12 is not going to do it. You make your way through the outer courtyard of the fortress passing rusted swords, decayed wooden emplacements, and rubble from the collapsing stone structure. You take a turn into the inner courtyard, with the keep just ahead of you, when you hear rattling and the sounds of steel on stone. All around you, skeletons lying in the snow begin assembling, stacking themselves up into moving figures wielding rusted swords and bows that shouldn’t work, but do. Since you rolled a failure with Fear, this opening move is going to be a big one.” Stella spends a Fear to make a group attack using the Skeleton Dredges. “All four of the smaller skeletons surround Lavelle, hacking and stabbing with their rusted blades.” Stella makes one attack for the group of skeletons according to the text of the group attack action. She rolls a d20, adding 1 token for the Skeleton Dredges’ attack modifier of −1. The die comes up a 15, −1 for 14. “Lavelle, what is your Evasion?” NOLAN: “It’s 13.” STELLA: “Then that’s a hit. You take 4 physical damage.” NOLAN: “That would be Minor damage, so I’m marking an Armor Slot to bring it down to nothing.” Nolan has an Armor Score of 3 from his gambeson armor, so he has 2 more uses of armor available. STELLA: “Now for the archers.” Stella spends another two Fear to spotlight two additional adversaries. “They’re going to attack Shepherd and Rune.” The archers are not using a group attack, so Stella rolls 1d20+2 twice (once for each Skeleton Archer). She rolls a 3 and an 8, for a total of 5 against Rune and 10 against Shepherd. The attack against Rune misses (5 is lower than his Evasion of 12), but the attack against Shepherd hits (they have an Evasion of 10, and if an attack total is equal to the target’s Evasion, the attack hits). Stella rolls 1d8+1 for the archer’s damage. It’s a total of 6—but that gets doubled thanks to the Skeleton Archers’ “Opportunist” feature, which says, “When two or more adversaries are within Very Close range of a target, all damage the archer deals to that target is doubled.” Since the Skeleton Dredges mobbed the group, the archers are able to fire in moments when the heroes are more open. “That’s 12 physical damage for Shepherd.” Stella turns to Quinn to see what they want to do about the damage taken by Shepherd. QUINN: “12 is Major damage, so I’ll mark armor and only take Minor damage.” Quinn marks an Armor Slot on their sheet. But since a character can only mark armor once per attack, they can’t completely negate the attack, and must mark a Hit Point for Minor damage. Shepherd's Armor Score is 4, so they have three more uses of armor before it needs repairs. Stella spends another Fear to spotlight the Skeleton Knight. STELLA: “Once the other skeletons have engaged and the archers have loosed their arrows, the Skeleton Knight stomps forward and takes a big swing at Tabby.” The Skeleton Knight has a +2 modifier, so Stella adds 2 tokens to the d20. She rolls a 14 and adds +2 for a total of 16. “I’m pretty sure a 16 hits Tabby?” ALIYAH: “It does, alas.” Stella rolls 1d10+2 for damage, getting a total of 10. 135 Chapter 2: Full Example of Play"

Their ‘Terrifying’ feature causes Tabby and everyone within Close range of her to lose a Hope, plus I will take a Fear.” ALIYAH: “That's all of us.” All four characters lose a Hope and Stella takes a Fear. The total of 10 would be Major damage, so Aliyah marks an Armor Slot to reduce it to Minor, then marks a Hit Point. Every adversary has activated during this turn, and Stella wants to hold on to some Fear for later, so she returns the spotlight to the PCs. STELLA: “The skeletons rushed you all at once like it was a practiced maneuver. I wonder how many other groups they’ve ambushed like this. What do you want to do?” MILES: “This is going to be their last ambush. Magical flame ignites in my hands, and I hurl it at the skeletons I’m in melee with. I’m going to use ‘Wild Flame,’ targeting two of the little ones and the big one with the sword.” STELLA: “Cool, roll spellcast as your attack roll.” MILES: “This is exactly what my War College Prodigy Experience prepared me for.” Miles spends a Hope to add 2 tokens from his Experience to his +3 bonus from his Knowledge. He rolls 9 on the Hope Die, 11 on the Fear Die, then adds +5 from his modifiers. “That’s a 25 with Fear.” Stella gains a Fear. STELLA: “So you’ll get your bonus damage from School of War, and each of them has to mark a Stress because of Wild Flame. Let’s see that damage roll!” Miles rolls 2d6 for the “Wild Flame” spell, plus an extra d10 for his foundation subclass feature. He gets a total of 17 magic damage, which is compared to each of the three targets’ damage thresholds. Since the dredges have the “Minion (4)” feature, every 4 damage dealt to them kills an additional dredge in range. The 17 damage is enough to kill all four minions in one blow. STELLA: “Nice. With one graceful sweep of your hands, you hit the first two you were aiming for, who collapse as you continue to erupt fire. Since they were minions, 17 damage was enough to kill all four of them. You turn them to ash.” Next, Stella looks at the knight’s thresholds. A 17 is above the Severe threshold. “You turn your fire on the Skeleton Knight. Their armor begins to melt and sag, melding to the bone. The knight’s still coming, but you dealt them a Severe blow.” Stella marks 3 HP for the knight. “Since you rolled with Fear, I’m going to spotlight the Skeleton Knight. As the minions collapse, the knight roars with an unearthly voice, eyes glowing yellow with malice. They raise the greatsword and hack into the group with huge sweeping blows. I’m marking a Stress to attack all enemies within Very Close range. So all four of you.” Stella rolls 1d20+2 for the attack, getting 6+2 for a total of 8. That total is compared to each character’s Evasion. Luckily, every PC’s evasion is above 8 and the attack misses entirely. Stella spends a Fear to spotlight one of the archers, who attacks Shepherd. But this time Stella rolls a 4, for a total of 6, which is below Shepherd’s Evasion. After that attack, Stella decides to save her Fear, since this encounter is just a warmup. STELLA: “The knight is rampaging while the archers pelt you with arrows. What do you do?” ALIYAH: “I’d love to take a swing at them.” The others nod. “I’m going to mark Stress to use ‘Reckless’ and get advantage on an attack against the big boy. And I’ll spend a Hope to Utilize my Pit Fighter Experience for +2.” Aliyah rolls 5 on the Hope Die, 5 on the Fear Die, and 3 on the advantage die, +3 for Agility since Tabby’s using a broadsword, +1 from the broadsword’s “Reliable” feature, and +2 for her Experience. “My total is 19, but since the dice matched, it’s a critical success!” STELLA: “Amazing! Give me that critical damage roll!” ALIYAH: “I just got my second point of Proficiency, and the broadsword has d8 damage dice. So that’s 16 plus a normal roll of 2d8, and +2 for my level thanks to ‘Combat Training.’” Aliyah rolls a 1 and a 4, but rerolls the 1 thanks to her Blade domain ability Not Good Enough, getting an 8. She adds 8+4+2 (because of her “Combat Training” feature) for a total of 14, and then she adds that to 16 because of the critical hit. An amazing 30 damage! That’s a Severe hit for the Skeleton Knight, who only had 2 HP left.

I get right up in their face so they can’t bring the sword to bear. Then I hack them apart like I’m chopping wood. There goes the tibia; there goes the humerus. Then, I bring my sword around and do a backflip, chopping off the knight’s head. I land with my shield bracing me as the knight topples into a shattering pile of bones.” STELLA: “Amazing. Make sure to clear a Stress and gain a Hope from your crit. And as the skeleton collapses, they have one final reaction that triggers when they’re killed—they lash out with the last of their strength to try to bring you with them, clawing at you with a great skeletal hand.” Stella rolls 1d20+2 and gets a 16+2 for 18. She rolls 1d4+8 damage and gets a 4 for a total of 12. Because the knight’s “Dig Two Graves” feature also forces the PC to lose 1d4 Hope, she rolls a d4, for a result of 2. Because Tabby critically succeeded, Stella chooses to omit the “Terrifying” feature from this attack. “The Skeleton Knight deals 12 physical damage back, and steals 2 Hope from you as unlife fades from their bones.” ALIYAH: “Oof. That’s Major damage, but I still have armor to spend, so I’m going to mark that and just take Minor damage.” Aliyah marks an Armor Slot and marks a Hit Point for Minor damage. She also loses 2 Hope from the “Dig Two Graves” action. STELLA: “As you all look up from the destroyed knight, you see that the archers have collapsed back into piles of bones. Rune, you remember lore about groups of skeletons where the spell used to animate them is focused on one of the group, usually the strongest.” MILES: “So next time, we go straight for the big one.” With the combat complete, Stella takes a breath and resets the scene. STELLA: “You’re alone in the inner courtyard, the destroyed remains of skeletons around you. What do you do?” QUINN:“‘I’m guessing that’s not the last surprise we’ll see today,’ Shepherd says. ‘In we go?’” NOLAN: “Yes, but this time I want to be scanning for threats.” In some situations, Stella might rule that Lavelle could just hear adversaries coming, but she wants to emphasize the danger and uncertainty of this ruin. STELLA: “That’s an Instinct Roll.” MILES: “Rune can help by listening for more of those strange building-waking-up sounds or anything else suspicious.” Miles spends a Hope, rolls a d6 advantage die, and gets a 3. Nolan makes an Instinct Roll for Lavelle. He gets a 1 on the Hope Die and a 5 on the Fear Die. Nolan adds his Duality Dice together for a value of 6, +1 for his Instinct, and +3 for Rune’s help, for a total of 10 with Fear. Stella nods, thinking for a moment as she gains a Fear. STELLA: “You enter the keep with caution, looking for traps and listening for threats. The base of the tower is littered with the decayed remains of many different kinds of folk—galapa and katari, dwarves and infernis. But none of them stir. You go through a barracks and a kitchen, finding the stairwell that leads you down into the musty basement. “There’s no light here, but you have torches. Here and there are some traps somehow still intact, or perhaps repaired. There are three somewhat-fresh corpses of adventurers that must have been the survivor’s companions. At this altitude, they’re pretty well preserved. Two are impaled on a wall of spikes that jutted out from one side. The third is wrapped in the embrace of another Skeleton Knight, but that one does not move. “But what you don’t see, dear adventurers, is the wraith emerging from the wall behind you, looming over Shepherd and Tabby as Lavelle and Rune take the lead. The wraith grows wide, its midnight eyes devouring the light behind you. The room grows cold as it reaches out toward you… and that’s where we’ll end for tonight.” The table erupts into excited chatter as the players debrief from their session together. 137 Chapter 2: Full Example of Play"

Those archers hadn’t taken any damage, but Stella described them falling apart after the knight died. Do you feel like that was a satisfying end to the combat, or would you have had the archers keep fighting? The explanation Stella offered to Rune could be taken as precedent, so if Stella chooses to not end a fight early in the future when the party destroys the most powerful skeleton, she’ll want to have an idea in mind why things are different the second time to maintain the integrity of the story. • Stella allowed Rune to make two jumps using the “Arcane Door” spell rather than making him roll for each casting. When a character is using an ability like that, do you want to call for a roll for each use or let one roll represent chaining the ability a couple of times like Stella did? • Would you have chosen to use “Terrifying” when the Skeleton Knight hit Tabby with “Dig Two Graves?” You don’t always have to use every one of an adversary’s features, and Stella skipped it to honor Tabby’s critical success. • In the fight with the skeletons, would you have had them attack the group in the order and fashion that Stella did? Choosing which adversaries to spotlight—and when—helps determine the shape of the fight and its rhythm, the ups and downs. How else could that fight have gone? Would you have waited to use the archers until after the Skeleton Knight? • Rune destroyed all four skeleton minions in one good hit, which meant the attack on the other skeletons was wasted. Would you have allowed Rune to use that other “Wild Flame” attack to attack the Skeleton twice, or maybe to hit one of the archers even though they were out of range? Or does losing the extra attack seem like a fair price for the certainty of being able to remove the minions? • What would you have done if Shepherd had rolled a success with Fear when using their “Nature’s Tongue” spell to talk to the goat? What would have been an interesting consequence if Shepherd failed that roll entirely? Would the goat have run off, or would you have introduced another complication during their ascent? Is there some complication that Stella could have used to foreshadow the skeletons or the wraith? Or would it have been better to gain a Fear and let the players keep pressing forward without an immediate consequence? As you consider your answers to these questions and make rulings during the game, you’ll develop your own GM style. That’s the key point to take away from this: there is no right answer. It all comes down to your group and what creates the best experience for your table. Your GM style might even change over time, and that’s okay, too. Next up is chapter 3, which will give you the tools you need to run a great game for your players. 138 Chapter 2: Full Example of Play"

If you’re reading the book to create and play a character, you’ve reached the end of what you need to know. If you’re a game master, read on! introduction As a game master, you are responsible for guiding the narrative and playing as the world that exists around your PCs. You are the massive sandstorm that hinders their journey, the innkeeper they befriend while seeking shelter, the mysterious stranger in the corner who asks them for help, or anything else that comes up during a session. Being a GM can be one of the most fun, exhilarating, and fulfilling experiences at the table—but it can also be intimidating, especially when you’re learning a new system. Parts of this chapter are much more conversational than the rest of the book. The previous chapters were primarily focused on delivering the mechanics of the game; while we’re going to cover mechanics in this chapter as well, we’re also going to talk about topics that lend themselves much better to a conversation than hard-and-fast rules: aspects of gameplay like story structure, improv, and world-building. Because, at the end of the day, the “big secret” about GMing is that you aren’t bound by a rigid ruleset like the players—you get to make it all up. Whether you made it up the week before, the day before, or in the moment at the table, you’re always crafting an experience for your players through the decisions you make. This chapter is dedicated to giving you the tools you need to run a game of Daggerheart: understanding the core mechanics; creating memorable encounters; planning exciting sessions; knowing how to select, create, and use GM moves; crafting a full campaign; running dynamic NPCs; and more. Core Guidance In this section, you’ll find some core guidance on how to run Daggerheart: • GM Principles • GM Best Practices • Pitfalls To Avoid These three sections provide a foundation to help you get the most out of this game. The “GM Principles” are your guiding star—when in doubt, return to these principles. The “GM Best Practices” provide examples for you to follow, while “Pitfalls to Avoid” shows you what to stay away from when GMing Daggerheart. As you read, don’t forget “The Golden Rule” on page 7. Whether you are a first-time GM, a veteran behind the screen, or anything in between, we encourage you to embrace the parts of this chapter that resonate with you and modify portions that don’t. 140 Chapter 3: Running an Adventure"

This game shares many characteristics with its predecessors—an attention to dramatized combat, familiar fantasy ancestries and archetypes, common touchstones from popular culture and folklore, and more. In addition, as you can see in the “Touchstones” section in the Introduction, Daggerheart draws inspiration from a variety of TTRPGs and other media beyond the fantasy adventure genre. Daggerheart prioritizes and provides the tools for telling a certain kind of heroic fantasy story. The system is focused on building collaborative, character-focused stories full of emotion, and it weaves the narrative through the entire experience, including its combat. Battle comes alive when the dramatic beats and rhythm highlight the conflicting motivations of combatants, when the characters’ bonds impact their decisions in the fight, and when there is a goal beyond simply killing every combatant. Daggerheart truly shines when the battles against adversaries are a dramatic beat in a larger, emotionally grounded story about the wants and needs of the characters. Following these GM principles will help the whole table have the best possible experience playing this game: → Begin and end with the fiction. → Collaborate at all times, especially during conflict. → Fill the world with life, wonder, and danger. → Ask questions and incorporate the answers. → Make every roll important. → Play to find out what happens. → Hold on gently. BEGIN AND END WITH THE FICTION “The fiction” refers to the story being created as you play. Use the fiction to drive mechanics—for example, when to call for rolls, which GM moves to use, what Difficulty a roll should be, or whether it should have advantage or disadvantage. Daggerheart’s rules exist to facilitate collaborative storytelling, so the flow of play should begin with narrative and lead to mechanics when needed. The GM then connects the results of the mechanics back to the fiction so play can continue smoothly. 142 Chapter 3: Core Guidance"

You’re all working together to tell an exciting, memorable story where heroes face incredible odds and often win in the end. Antagonism between player and GM should exist only in the fiction of the game, through the actions of NPCs and opposition within the narrative. Neither the PCs nor the players are your “enemy.” They’re the opponents of the adversaries you play, but you and the players are on the same side: the side invested in telling an amazing story together. When representing antagonists and challenges, your main job is to balance presenting credible threats with maintaining the trust of the players so that the collaborative process can succeed. Part of collaboration is being a fan of the players and a fan of their characters. Being a fan of the players means consciously including story elements and themes they’ve expressed interest in. It also means giving them the benefit of the doubt when they forget something small—especially something that their character wouldn’t forget. Being a fan of the PCs means that while you’ll make their life challenging, up to and potentially including death, you’re never rooting for them to lose—you’re working with the players to ensure that the characters’ story is exciting and the environment around them is behaving with internal consistency. FILL THE WORLD WITH LIFE, WONDER, AND DANGER Daggerheart is a game of action, adventure, and high fantasy. One of your biggest jobs as the GM is to present a world worthy of heroic tales. When running a player-driven game, you can take the characters’ details, backgrounds, connection questions, and worldbuilding notes your players provided both in and out of your session zero (see the upcoming “Session Zero and Safety Tools” section on page 169) and use those as a palette to paint an exciting world. Fill it with vibrant adventures that showcase rich cultures, take the PCs to wondrous places, and introduce them to dangerous creatures. Strive to ground all of this in a place that honors the motivations and personhood of everyone, from preeminent high nobility and demigods to humble farmers and artisans. ASK QUESTIONS AND INCORPORATE THE ANSWERS In Daggerheart, the GM doesn’t have to do all the heavy lifting in terms of worldbuilding; we encourage you to share narrative authority with the players. Many players will be drawn more fully into the story when you empower them to add their own touches and details to your shared world. When the party enters a character’s hometown, you might invite that player to describe the local market. Rather than narrating a character’s deadly blow on a critical success, you can ask the player to take the spotlight and detail their triumph. In dramatic or even commonplace moments, you might ask questions about a character’s motivations, emotions, and history, then connect the answers to the current moment. Some groups may want to go even further, closing the gap in narrative authority between players and GM by letting players take authorship over entire regions or nations. Your players’ involvement shows their interest in the story—do your best to respect their investment and fold their contributions into the tale. As the GM, it’s your job to maintain the integrity of the world and make adjustments when needed, but ensuring that the players’ ideas are included results in a narrative that supports the whole group’s creativity. MAKE EVERY ROLL IMPORTANT Action rolls in Daggerheart describe and resolve a moment within a story; these moments might be as short as a split- second dodge, as long as a full exchange of blows in combat, or an entire montage of chasing leads over the course of an evening. Because the GM can choose to make a move in response to a player’s failed roll or a result with Fear, and since every roll generates Hope or Fear, only ask the players to roll during meaningful moments to ensure that every roll contributes to the story. Daggerheart is designed for cinematic play— when you provide information freely and allow characters to succeed at tasks in line with their skills, the moments where characters do roll carry more risk and weight. Failures should create heartbreaking complications or unexpected challenges, while successes should feel like soaring triumphs! PLAY TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS Daggerheart thrives when the focus is on the emotional journey of the PCs and the GM leaves room for their impact. You’re not playing a pre-planned story—the overarching plot of your campaign will emerge when you collaborate with the players to weave together the characters’ stories, the world, and major events. Actively create room to be surprised by what the characters will do, the choices they’ll make, and the people they’ll become. Try to prepare situations without expectations about the solutions the players will find or create. While preparing adversaries and appropriate maps can help make for exciting scenes, always know you can adjust or completely throw out plans to follow inspiration when it strikes at the table. HOLD ON GENTLY Improvisational storytelling isn’t always perfect, and that’s okay. Hold on gently to the fiction, enough so that you don’t lose the pieces that matter, but not so tightly that the narrative has no room to breathe. Let yourself make mistakes and make changes. Smooth the edges and shape them to fit the story. You’ll be the final arbiter and editor, but don’t worry if you need to go back and revisit or retroactively change something that came before. 143 Chapter 3: Core Guidance"

Think of the principles as the guiding stars for your game’s ship, and the practices are the sails, ropes, and oars the ship uses to traverse that route. → Cultivate a curious table. → Gain your players’ trust. → Keep the story moving forward. → Cut to the action. → Help the players use the game. → Create a meta conversation. → Tell them what they would know. → Ground the world in motive. → Bring the game’s mechanics to life. → Reframe rather than reject. → Work in moments and montages. CULTIVATE A CURIOUS TABLE Tantalize players with a suspicious line muttered under an NPC’s breath, illustrate the signs of a lingering magical threat shimmering among the trees, hint at future danger looming over the distant horizon. Throw out hooks and see what catches their interest. Foster an environment of creative inquiry at the table and allow that curiosity to lead you to incredible places. GAIN YOUR PLAYERS’ TRUST Trust is essential for a successful game of Daggerheart. The GM trusts the players to represent their characters' actions thoughtfully while keeping the table’s shared goals in mind. The players trust the GM is acting in good faith—that when you’re introducing challenges and doling out consequences, you’re doing so with their interests in mind. Make promises and then follow through on them. Maybe an innkeeper tells you they heard strange sounds coming from the basement at night. When the PCs go to the basement that evening, give them something interesting to find. Let players’ hunches come to fruition when you can—let them feel like their understanding of the world is correct even if it’s incomplete. Perhaps the dangerous person they’re tracking did come through the shop they just visited, or the ancient book they’re seeking can be found in the library from a PC’s backstory the party is now headed toward. When resolving an action, deliver on the expectations you set when you called for the roll. If you tell the PC that a successful Agility Roll will let them jump from their airship to another, when they succeed, let them do it. This also means admitting when you misstep or misspeak, and checking in with your players when you’re unsure what they intend. If you didn’t realize a player was expecting to bypass the entire patrol of guards with a single roll, you might back the scene up and reestablish the stakes. Alternatively, you might just let them know you’ll be more clear next time and allow them to sneak by the patrol this time. KEEP THE STORY MOVING FORWARD Every time a player makes an action roll, the story should move forward, success or failure. On a failure, the GM says how the world responds and keeps the story moving. This is often referred to as “failing forward.” A character might not get what they want if the roll goes poorly, but the story advances through escalation, new information, or some other change in circumstances. CUT TO THE ACTION Heroic fantasy stories consist of dramatic scenes, travel montages, and downtempo moments around a campfire as the heroes decompress and prepare for what’s ahead. If the travel between two places won’t result in danger or interesting challenges and everyone is excited to press forward, you can cut ahead to the action by saying something like, “So you travel to Oldhome. Instead of playing this out and doing long rests, just clear all your marked Hit Points, Stress, and Armor Slots. We pick up on the edge of town after two long days on the road. It’s only twilight, but you haven’t seen anyone in any of the outlying farms. There’s no sound coming from the tavern just ahead on your right. What do you do?” When a scene feels like it’s dragging or going in circles, you can cut to a new scene to keep the narrative moving, letting the players know they can flash back to the details of the plan or get their story straight later. Note that action doesn’t always mean combat. Action can be tense political drama as the party tries to maintain an alliance hanging by a thread. It can be navigating an archmage’s warded and trapped hedge maze. It can be an emotional scene between a character and an NPC from their past. “Action” means any time there is tension and uncertainty—situations that challenge the characters. If the PCs have an enemy on the ropes and the players’ interest seems to be wavering, go ahead and have the foe run off or surrender. Alternatively, just ask the players how they finish out the fight. You should do your best to not let a scene become a slog where everyone feels obligated to see it through, even when no one is having fun. Part of being the GM is knowing which moments to focus on and which to push off-screen. HELP THE PLAYERS USE THE GAME If you’re the GM, there’s a good chance that you’re the person who has spent the most time learning Daggerheart’s rules. Thus, you are best equipped to help your table understand how to play. Help players reach the point where they see the rules as a toolkit used to tell the story together, not as an obstacle that stands between them and enjoying the experience of play. The GM plays the opposition to the characters, but they’re working with the players to tell the story. If the players are missing something obvious or seem to be forgetting an ability, don’t be afraid to guide them to it. The better an understanding the players have of the rules and mechanics, the better they’re equipped to face increasingly difficult situations and find clever ways to solve problems. 144 Chapter 3: Core Guidance"

Whether as creative collaborators or friends enjoying a game together, players should feel empowered to utilize safety tools during the game or ask for clarifications concerning the story or rules. TELL THEM WHAT THEY WOULD KNOW While the characters live in the fictional world and can utilize all their senses to experience it, the players only know what is established by your descriptions. Help the players by sharing details about their environment, giving them critical information, and offering facts their characters would easily know or have already discovered. For example, three players will all imagine “a wizard’s tower” differently, so include the specific details that will shape their understanding of this particular wizard’s tower. In many cases, if you don’t describe something, it doesn’t exist in the minds of the other people at your table. If there is information in a scene that characters would be able to perceive just by being in the space, don’t gate those details behind a roll. For instance, if a PC asks about a desk or chest within the tower that the wizard might use to store important notes, you can explain that the desk is clean and has no drawers, but there is a large bookshelf filled with scrolls and stacks of paper. This is a detail the character could easily see without effort—you don’t need to ask the player to roll. GROUND THE WORLD IN MOTIVE The characters in Daggerheart are driven by their motivations. An ambitious baroness wants to gain status and increase her sphere of influence, so she acts to extend her power. A large swamp serpent is motivated by hunger and safety, so they hunt outsiders, but they might not chase them beyond the muddy water if they’re sated. Each adversary stat block suggests a couple general motives, but when you’re depicting important NPCs, consider both their short-term and long-term goals. A renowned thief might be most immediately driven by a desire to steal crown jewels from a caravan, but their ultimate goal is to avoid capture by the king’s guard—when both of these motivations impact their decisions, this creates a multidimensional character. The players might not always know a character’s true motives, but if you keep motivation in mind, you can depict the world with depth and consistency. When you hint at or reveal an NPC’s motives, the players can push and pull on the NPC’s hopes and fears to create dynamic bonds. Action without motivation can feel like choreography. When a supposed ally betrays the party, your story will hit harder if the players understand their motivations, truly making the betrayal both sudden and (in retrospect) inevitable. BRING THE GAME’S MECHANICS TO LIFE Set a good example of how fiction and mechanics work together to enhance the game experience. For example, when an incoming storm will bring disaster to the nearby port town, place a countdown (see the upcoming “Countdowns” section on page 162) on the table labeled “The storm ravages Port Emerald” to show that the threat is real. Mechanics and storytelling accentuate each other in nearly every aspect of the game. When a PC rolls a failure with Fear, go hard with your description of the consequence to convey the gravity of the fallout, demonstrating the difference between a failure with Hope and one with Fear. Embody the enemy’s fatigue and desperation as they mark their last Stress but continue to goad the party on. If the heroes are ambushed by a large band of raiders, lay out your battlemat and set down figures for all fourteen enemies to show how outnumbered the party is. Whenever possible, let the mechanics of the game drive the story you’re telling and let the fiction you’ve created reinforce the mechanics you’re using. REFRAME RATHER THAN REJECT If a player’s suggestion or description is generally implausible or out of sync with what has been established in the game, try to find a way to reframe the situation and work with them rather than rejecting their idea outright. You might ask the table what it would take to accomplish a seemingly implausible task, or call out a more workable part of the suggestion and encourage the player to build on that aspect. Example: “Well, you might not be able to fly up to the platform using the Telekinesis spell in your grimoire, but there are plenty of large rocks here you could move around if you wanted.” WORK IN MOMENTS AND MONTAGES When framing a scene or playing out a beat of the story, think about moments and montages. If the stakes are high and you want to zoom in on the flash of blades or the coded language of courtly flirtation, you’re working in moments. Give those powerful, climactic moments their due, lingering on the emotion and giving players time to savor the scene. However, not every part of the story needs to be told in moment-by-moment description or full scenes. In those cases, consider using montage, a sequence of short descriptions or a summary that establishes what happens without lingering on the individual moments. Montage can be used for actions that take place over minutes, hours, or days. Example: “You spend the evening working the crowds to find leads on the Scorpion Society, but I don’t think we need to play it all out. Tell us a little about what that looks like and then make a Presence Roll.” 145 Chapter 3: Core Guidance"

Here are a few areas where hang-ups are more likely to occur when running Daggerheart, and ways to help your games run more smoothly if you encounter them. → Undermining the heroes → Always telling the players what to roll → Letting scenes drag → Singular solutions → Overplanning → Hoarding Fear UNDERMINING THE HEROES Even at level 1, the heroes possess both talent and experience. This is a heroic fantasy game, and so the characters are assumed to be skilled in the basics of adventuring. When a roll doesn’t go well, things go badly and the character doesn’t get what they want. Rather than describing the PCs being incompetent, it’s often better to show how the failure was impacted by their target’s prowess, environmental factors, or unexpected surprises. An easy way to make this work is to describe the cool or smart move the character was making, then say “But…” and narrate a surprise, complication, or escalation. “Your blade slices through the air with grace, aimed perfectly at the guard’s shoulder. But she reacts just fast enough to bring up the haft of her halberd to block your blow, then swings her weapon to try to pin you against the wall. She’s way faster than a random guard at an outpost like this should be. What’s a soldier with her skill doing stuck all the way out here?” If the group has decided on a more comical tone, this guidance might not apply, but the default for Daggerheart is to assume the PCs are competent adventurers and make the story exciting by depicting capable heroes struggling with extraordinary challenges. ALWAYS TELLING THE PLAYERS WHAT TO ROLL Daggerheart’s collaborative approach encourages players to express their character’s personalities through creative problem-solving. In some situations, there might really only be one trait that’s appropriate to roll; for example, traversing a slippery bridge is almost always going to be an Agility Roll. But in many situations, you can give the players the freedom to decide how they’re going to handle a challenge and what trait they want to use to accomplish the roll. Example: Stella, the GM, says “The spellrider on the giant bat just broke the enchantment keeping your airship aloft. You’re all going to need to give me a roll to deal with the imminent fall. What do you do?” Aliyah says, “I’m going to jump off the ship, grab a hold of the bat to climb up, and wrestle the spellrider out of the saddle. Can I do that with Agility?” Nolan says, “I want to make a Finesse Roll using my Pirate Experience to cut one of the smaller sails free and use it like a parachute.” LETTING SCENES DRAG Ideally, scenes should be focused, carrying the momentum of the story forward. Each roll should progress the narrative and build or resolve tension. At the natural conclusion of a scene, when the table energy is flagging, or when the players or characters are talking in circles, consider shaking up the scene or resolving it and cutting away to a new one to maintain that momentum. In social situations, prompt them to action by making a relevant GM move to introduce a ticking clock, provide new information, foreshadow future danger, or something similar. In a combat that’s dragging, remember not all conflicts need to end with the enemy’s death—change things up or create a dramatic resolution, such as an escape, a natural disaster, or an intervention by an authoritative power. SINGULAR SOLUTIONS If the GM has exactly one idea in mind for how the PCs can solve a given problem, it can become challenging if the players get excited about another answer. You might have good reason for why the solution you have in mind is the best option, but if the players have a clever idea, it’s often smart to adjust in the moment and figure out how to make their approach work. Puzzles are a great example of a situation where a singular solution can cause problems. Everyone’s minds work in different ways, and a puzzle or riddle with only one “right” answer can shut down interesting alternatives. If the players get bogged down or frustrated with a puzzle or scene, consider finding a way to move things along or adjust the situation to let the character’s actions advance the story. This might involve showing your hand to give the players more context or checking in to ask how they’re feeling about a scene. 146 Chapter 3: Core Guidance"

The game is also built to be player driven, where the PCs’ backgrounds and connections serve as the primary fuel for the plot. For these reasons, we recommend leaving space for the story to breathe. The game works better when more preparation time goes into situations for the characters to explore rather than scripting entire scenes and a set progression of story beats. Every GM’s style is different, and you may find that you benefit with more time spent on forms of preparation that allow you to utilize player agency and creativity. Your players will often surprise you with daring or risky actions you could never anticipate. When these great ideas come up, read the energy of the table and see if they’re all excited about this new direction, and what opposition or narrative responses might feed their enthusiasm. It’s okay to tell your players: “That took me by surprise. How about a quick ten minute break while I think about how this exciting change will play out?” HOARDING FEAR Because you gain Fear any time a PC rolls with Fear, as well as during downtime, you’ll often have a stockpile of Fear to draw on when you need it. Do your best to spend that Fear when you have the opportunity. Spending more Fear at the start of a combat or during a big moment can generate a lot of tension and set the stakes. This helps give shape to the scene, where the PCs are on the ropes, being reactive more than proactive as they fight to get their footing. Then, as they get their equilibrium, they become proactive, directly pursuing their objectives. Once they’ve made some strides toward those objectives, they may roll with Fear. This creates an opening for you to make another Fear move to complicate the scene. This back-and-forth creates a dynamic scene, keeping the PCs on their toes and ultimately making the result all the more satisfying whether it’s a hard-earned victory or a heartbreaking defeat. 147 Chapter 3: Core Guidance"

THE GM’S DIE The players use two d12 Duality Dice as their primary dice for action resolution, but as the GM, you’ll use one d20. This creates a less predictable outcome for your rolls, while the players will have more reliable results. You’re just as likely to roll abysmally high or low as you are to roll a middling number, whereas rolling two d12s creates a more stable bell curve of results. When you succeed, it creates a new and exciting challenge, and when you fail, it is a relief and a boon for the players. The swingy nature of the d20’s results helps facilitate a variety of outcomes during a session. MAKING GM ROLLS When an adversary attacks a PC, you roll to determine the outcome. This follows a similar process to PC action rolls, except you use a d20 instead of two d12s: STEP 1: CALCULATE THE ATTACK ROLL Roll your d20 and add the adversary’s attack bonus (along with any other dice, such as an additional d20 for advantage). STEP 2: DETERMINE IF THE ATTACK HITS If the roll result meets or beats the target PC’s Evasion, the attack succeeds and hits the target. Otherwise, the attack fails and doesn’t hit. STEP 3: ON A HIT, ROLL FOR DAMAGE On a success, roll the appropriate damage dice to determine how much damage the attack deals. If you ever want to increase the chances an adversary will succeed or fail, you can increase or decrease their attack modifier. GM Critical Successes PCs aren’t the only characters who can roll a critical success—their adversaries can too! Whenever you roll a 20 on the d20, your roll automatically succeeds. If you critically succeed on an attack roll, you also deal extra damage. Start with the highest possible value the damage dice can roll, and then make a damage roll as usual, adding it to that value. For example, if the damage dice are 2d8+2 and you critically succeed on the roll, you would automatically deal 16 damage. You then roll the dice and get a 5 and a 7. So you add 16+5+7 for 28, plus 2 for the modifier, for a total of 30 damage. A critical success on a reaction roll does not have any added benefit for an adversary. CALLING FOR ACTION ROLLS After a player describes a move they want to make during the game, you might decide an action roll is necessary to determine how the scene progresses. Use this guide to determine what to present the player, choosing whichever option best fits the situation: • Let the PC guarantee success in exchange for a consequence. If there is an opportunity for an interesting consequence, offer the player that outcome in exchange for performing the move without a roll; should they agree, the PC succeeds and you narrate the repercussions. For example, rather than rolling to see if a PC can jump from one roof to another, you might allow them to automatically succeed in exchange for being noticed by bystanders on the street beneath them. • Establish the stakes. If a move is particularly difficult or dangerous and offers interesting consequences for success or failure, establish the stakes for the roll so that the player knows what to expect. Once everyone is aligned, ask the player to roll and shape the fiction around the results. For example, you can inform a player whose wants their PC to leap across rooftops that they’ll jump without alerting anyone on a success, but a failure will mean they crash into the streets below, suffering heavy injuries. This empowers the player to take informed risks and lean into the fiction. • Make clear any guaranteed consequences. If a move is particularly difficult or dangerous, and if it will certainly have repercussions regardless of whether the PC succeeds or not, tell the player about those repercussions before the move occurs. If the player wishes to proceed with the move, ask them to roll and narrate the consequences without compromising on your repercussions. For example, you might tell a player who wants their PC to jump from the roof of a burning building to safety that the roof will collapse in the attempt. Even if the roll succeeds spectacularly, narrate the building groaning and collapsing in on itself, preventing anyone after from performing the same escape. EXPERIENCES IMPACT FICTION When determining whether or not a roll is necessary, always consider a PC’s Experiences and narrative history. For example, if a PC has the “Expert Climber” Experience and they’re attempting to scale a wall with no danger around, you might decide they don’t need to roll—they can just do it. If the climb would be tricky due to weather, but you don’t want the story to focus on what happens if they fail, you might offer them the option of marking a Stress in exchange for climbing without a roll. A character’s history should lessen their need to roll things they’re experienced in—you should introduce rolls only when circumstances fall outside of their Experience, such as the PC trying to climb while archers rain arrows down from parapets above. 148 Chapter 3: Core GM Mechanics"

Unlike the PCs, you aren’t bound by specific spells you can cast or certain effects you can do—when you make GM moves, you are acting to shape and facilitate the story, whatever that requires. When you begin a GM move, you are starting your GM turn. When you are done making your GM move (or moves) and play passes back to the PCs, your GM turn is over. At its most simple, a GM move is anything you do that guides the story. These moves can heighten the danger, often by introducing conflict or increasing the Difficulty, or they can offer ease and support, often by revealing new information or relieving a burden. This ebb and flow of opposition and cooperation facilitates dynamic play and invites opportunities for both GMs and players to surprise one another with exciting choices. If moves are your chance to make things happen in the scene, what should you do? The upcoming sections provide suggestions (and examples in the “Example GM Moves” section), but these decisions are hard to make in a vacuum. The best tool you have at your disposal is listening to your players as they add to the narrative, then weaving your moves into theirs. WHEN TO MAKE A MOVE Knowing when to make moves (and what kind of moves to make) is a significant part of learning to GM Daggerheart. The frequency and severity of these moves depends on the type of story you’re telling, the actions your players take, and the tone of the session you’re running, but the general rule of thumb is this: you can make a GM move whenever you want. That’s right! You’re the GM—your job is not to crush the PCs or always act adversarially; it’s to help tell a story. You should be making moves whenever you see an opportunity to do so. Consider making a GM move when a player does one of the following things: • Rolls with Fear on an action roll. • Fails an action roll. • Does something that would have consequences. • Gives you a golden opportunity. • Looks to you for what happens next. Note that making a big move isn’t always necessary! When you can’t see an opening for a narratively impactful move, remember the other tools in your toolkit: make a PC mark a Stress, progress an event happening outside the current scene, or even defer the consequence for later. For example, perhaps nothing happens when you break the cursed object now, but its rightful owner might come to collect their due down the line. They Roll with Fear on an Action Roll If a PC rolls with Fear, play returns to you to make a GM move. Whether their roll failed or succeeded, your move should generally build on the action the player just attempted. They Fail an Action Roll If a PC fails an action roll, play returns to you to describe the failure and what comes next in the story because of it. If it’s a failure with Fear, consider choosing a harsher consequence or complication than you would otherwise. They Do Something That Would Have Consequences Sometimes a PC makes a move that, regardless of whether they succeed or fail, has inevitable consequences. In these situations, you can make a move to reflect that outcome. For example, if a PC wants to save someone from a burning building, the player declares they want to run inside. You can explain to that player that no matter how high they roll, a consequence will occur: the character takes damage from the fire, the building collapses around them to prevent an easy escape, or something they’re carrying is damaged in the flames. They Give You a Golden Opportunity Sometimes, a PC’s decision gives you the perfect opportunity for a dramatic move—perhaps they move too close to a waiting predator or get distracted while watching for intruders. In these cases, a roll doesn’t prompt your move, but you can still seize the opportunity for a powerful dramatic beat. For example, if the PCs are hiding from a group of thieves while discussing the bandit leader’s plans, a PC might say with dramatic irony, “But surely they won’t look in the eaves of every barn in the district!” In response, you might describe the barn door noisily swinging open as a bandit steps inside, a lit torch in one hand and a sword in the other as they peer into the rafters where the characters are hiding. They Look to You for What Happens Next Your job is to keep the story moving, so when the players aren’t sure what to do, they’ll likely look to you to find out. This is usually a sign that you should make a move. For example, if the PCs are conversing with each other during a dinner party then reach a lull in the conversation, the players might glance at you to see if it’s time for an NPC to speak or take action. Similarly, you should make a move when the players are stumped about what to do or when they seem frustrated about a lack of information. When you need to get the scene moving again, a softer move might do the trick (see the upcoming “Softer and Harder Moves” section), but sometimes a harder move is needed to provoke the PCs to action. 149 Chapter 3: Core GM Mechanics"

Consider the following examples of phrases you might say to the player after an action roll, and what moves you might make: Critical Success “That’s a critical success! You get what you want and a little extra. Gain a Hope and clear a Stress. Tell me how this happens…” Let the player describe their success, then give the party an additional opportunity or advantage in the scene because of it. Success with Hope “That’s a success with Hope, so you get what you want. Gain a Hope. Tell me how this happens…” Let the player describe their success, then show how the world reacts to it. Success with Fear “That’s a success with Fear, so you get what you want, but it comes at a cost. I gain a Fear and here’s what happens…” Work together to describe the PC’s success, then introduce a complication or cost as a GM move—but don’t negate their success with this consequence. Maybe an adversary attacks them in response or they mark a Stress from the toll it took to succeed. Perhaps they realize their ally is in imminent danger or get new information that raises the stakes. Failure with Hope “That’s a failure with Hope, so things don’t go according to plan, but you gain a Hope. Here’s what happens…” Describe how the PC fails to get what they want, and how the situation goes wrong as a result, by introducing a minor complication or consequence as a GM move. Maybe they spot a new danger they must now contend with, face an attack or mark a Stress from an enemy they’re engaged with, or face collateral damage that puts them in a more difficult position. Failure with Fear “That’s a failure with Fear, so it doesn’t go well! I gain a Fear and here’s what happens…” Describe how things go wrong by introducing a major complication or consequence as a GM move. Maybe they receive bad news and the information puts them in immediate danger, they become the focus of multiple adversaries, they are separated from their party, or an important opportunity is lost for good. QUICK REFERENCE: RESOLVING ACTION ROLLS If you’re unsure how to resolve a roll, think about these quick phrases: Success with Hope: Yes, and… (You get what you want and gain a Hope.) Success with Fear: Yes, but… (You get what you want, but there’s a consequence, and the GM gains a Fear.) Failure with Hope: No, but… (Things don’t go as planned, but you gain a Hope.) Failure with Fear: No, and… (Things don’t go as planned and it gets worse. The GM gains a Fear.) Obvious Moves Sometimes, you’ll know without hesitation how to make a move in a scene. A PC just rolled a success with Fear on a melee attack against a powerful adversary? They get what they want, but it comes at a cost. In response, your move might have the adversary strike back or throw the PC across the battlefield. Maybe you’ve set up the scene so that they’re fighting on a precarious ledge, and the attack from the PC was successful, but momentum carries them dangerously close to the cliff’s edge and they must make an Agility Roll to see if they can keep from falling off. Other times, the move might not be immediately obvious. In that case, you can draw inspiration from the upcoming “Example GM Moves” section. If all else fails, either have the PC mark a Stress, or tell them “everything is fine… for now” and think about how you can bring more danger their way in a later scenario. Player-Driven Moves If you’re still not sure what to do, you might turn the decision over to the player, giving them an option of two different things or simply asking them what happens next. They sometimes put themselves in a more interesting or dangerous situation than you ever would’ve! Social Moves Keep in mind that GM moves are applicable in any situation. While combat mechanics naturally lend themselves to signaling when enemies attack, how much damage they deal, and so on, the concept of “making moves” applies across all scenarios within Daggerheart. A tense dinner between rivals, an important negotiation, an emotional confrontation—all of these scenes have a back-and-forth between the PCs and the GM. You can use moves to accomplish the single most important part of GMing: listening and responding to your players. 150 Chapter 3: Core GM Mechanics"

For example, if a PC makes a Finesse roll in an attempt to move stealthily through a hallway, and they succeed but roll with Fear, don’t use your move to sound an alarm bell or make someone bump into them, spoiling their cover. The PC succeeded on the roll, and that success should be honored, even if it comes with a consequence. Instead, consider options such as introducing a new obstacle at their target destination or adding a new enemy approaching from behind to complicate their situation. Similarly, if a PC does something cool—such as cleverly casting a spell—let them enjoy it instead of immediately foiling their schemes and let the scene play out for a while, using moves to change and escalate the scenario rather than end the effect. For example, a PC might circumvent a trap you laid; rather than immediately use a GM move to spring the trap into working, let the PC feel smart as you instead use your next GM move to summon more foes or telegraph what other dangers might be on the path ahead. Use your GM moves to immediately shut down an effect when it involves a climactic moment or a powerful adversary—when you need to show that the situation is dire. Keep this principle in mind as you make GM moves. The following sections provide advice on what kind of moves you can make and how to implement harder moves with care. After all, not every move will be enjoyed in every circumstance. If the PCs are delivering a powerful artifact to a wizard to be destroyed, having a minor adversary steal the artifact can spark an exciting story arc—or it can throw icy water on the party’s excitement and make them feel all their work to retrieve it was pointless. As always, communication and collaboration are key, and hard actions shouldn’t negate player agency or feel punishing. SOFTER AND HARDER MOVES When play turns to you, you have many options for how to respond. Some are soft moves that are generally easier on the players—they give the party new information about the scene and offer them an opportunity to react to it. Others are hard moves that are usually harsher, bigger, or more direct—this fiction happens without allowing PCs to intercede. Consider using softer moves on failures with Hope and harder moves on any roll with Fear. Additionally, you might start off a session using softer moves and progress into harder moves as the story comes to a climax. Remember that your moves set the tone for a challenge or threat. The next section contains example moves in approximate order of severity. 151 151 Chapter 3: Core GM Mechanics"

The way you make moves truly defines your story and style. Everyone who plays this game will interact with GM moves differently, so you should never feel like you have to use them the same way anyone else does! As long as you and your table are having fun, you’re staying true to the story, and you’re acting as a fan of your players, that’s what matters. The following examples span the gradient from softer moves to harder moves. Look down the list until you find the move that seems appropriate. Don’t describe your move in the terms used in this section. Instead of saying “I show the collateral damage,” contextualize it for the players—describe how their missed arrow pierces the frayed rope holding a lantern aloft, and now the room in the bandits’ hideaway has been set ablaze! When you make a GM move, you might try one of these: → Show how the world reacts. → Ask a question and build on the answer. → Make an NPC act in accordance with their motive. → Lean on the character’s goals to drive them to action. → Signal an imminent off-screen threat. → Reveal an unwelcome truth or unexpected danger. → Force the group to split up. → Make a PC mark Stress as a consequence for their actions. → Make a move the characters don’t see. → Show the collateral damage. → Clear a temporary condition or effect. → Shift the environment. → Spotlight an adversary. → Capture someone or something important. → Use a PC’s backstory against them. → Take away an opportunity permanently. SHOW HOW THE WORLD REACTS To show how the world reacts, simply think about the way the PC’s move has affected the world and narrate that change in a way that creates new opportunities for the PCs to act. At its softest, you might describe them successfully breaking down a door, then give them a description of the next room and what danger they find there. You could also make the person they’re negotiating with present an option for compromise, or have an enemy they just hit attempt to retreat. This is your opportunity to make the world around the PCs feel real and alive. ASK A QUESTION AND BUILD ON THE ANSWER This is perhaps the most collaborative move—presenting the player with a question, and using their answer as truth to build the scene. You might ask them something like, “What do you see in this city that reminds you of home?” or “What about this place tells you someone else was here before you?” Typically utilized when establishing information about a scene or when you’re interested in a specific character or player’s perspective on the current situation, this move can be a great way to get the whole table involved in worldbuilding during the game. MAKE AN NPC ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR MOTIVE When a scene includes characters other than the PCs, you can spotlight what these NPCs are doing in response to the PCs’ actions. You might show a friendly NPC helping the party in a fight, a group of townsfolk taking cover, or an enemy moving positions. Make sure their actions always flow from their motive. LEAN ON THE CHARACTER’S GOALS TO DRIVE THEM TO ACTION One of the most powerful ways to change a scene as a GM is to introduce something personal to the PCs. If the character is seeking out a specific object or creature, you might reveal where it is and why it’s going to be so challenging to get there. Using a PC’s desires to drive them forward is a great way to reinforce why this scene matters to them. SIGNAL AN IMMINENT OFF-SCREEN THREAT A rustle in the trees, an alarm bell being sounded, the clanging armor of reinforcements headed their way—this move creates a ticking clock for your PCs. They need to get moving now. REVEAL AN UNWELCOME TRUTH OR UNEXPECTED DANGER This versatile move is usually applicable in any scene—you’re simply heightening the drama or tension. Maybe an unexpected person steps out of the shadows, or the characters receive bad news that makes them rethink their plans. A soft version of this move might manifest as moving a group of dangerous foes within striking range of the PCs or revealing a guard captain just when the PCs think they have the upper hand over the guards. A harder version of this move might be an enemy pinning a PC against the wall, making a PC Restrained until they make a roll to escape the adversary’s grasp. FORCE THE GROUP TO SPLIT UP Usually the result of an environmental hazard or a trap, splitting up the party can force your players to think differently than they normally would about how to accomplish a task. This move can also make for some fun cutting back and forth between scenes as the two groups work independently before finding a way back to each other. 152 Chapter 3: Core GM Mechanics"

For example, the PC can charge across the battlefield, but they’ll mark a Stress to do it. As a softer move, you can also make this an offer instead—maybe you give them the choice to only make it halfway across and not mark a Stress. When you have a player mark Stress, describe why the circumstance is stressful—or ask the player to do so. Is it physically taxing in some way? Does it bring up painful memories? Is the PC under significant pressure? MAKE A MOVE THE CHARACTERS DON’T SEE This move is most useful when you have something happening behind the scenes that you’re waiting to reveal. You might start a new countdown or tick down a current one, add more damage dice to an enemy’s upcoming damage roll, adjust a narrative situation the PCs have yet to encounter, or create another consequence the players can’t foresee. When you do this, don’t tell them the move, but do create fun tension at the table by letting them know your machinations have changed: “Everything is fine… for now.” Depending on your style of play, you might instead tick down a countdown timer the players can see but don’t fully understand. You could also cut away to a scene that the players see but the characters don’t. SHOW THE COLLATERAL DAMAGE This is a great move to use when the player tries to do something powerful and there’s a consequence. That fireball that missed? Maybe it went wide, struck the side of the mountain, and now they hear rumbling from above. An avalanche is about to swallow them! Whenever a PC does something that significantly impacts the world around them, you can use this move to show them the natural ramifications of that event. CLEAR A TEMPORARY CONDITION OR EFFECT If there is a temporary condition or effect on an adversary or environment, you can choose to clear it. When you make this move, lead with the narrative, describing who or what causes the effect to end, then how it changes the PCs’ situation. For example, if an adversary is Vulnerable because they’re being held down by a tangle of vines, you might describe them using their blade to hack away at the vines to break free. Or if the effect is caused by a spell, you might describe the adversary unleashing a hail of arrows toward the caster, missing them but inhibiting their ability to focus on the spell any longer. If a PC just started an effect, think twice before ending it—it will be more satisfying if they see it impact the scene first. Clearing some conditions or effects might also require you to spend Fear. SHIFT THE ENVIRONMENT You can change the environment the PCs are navigating to raise the stakes. If you’re using an environment stat block, you could choose to utilize one of its actions. Otherwise, affect the area surrounding the PCs in a fun and engaging way—maybe the rope bridge they’re crossing suddenly snaps or a river sweeps them off their feet. Perhaps an angry crowd packs the marketplace, obscuring the person they’re following, or a building falls toward the PCs after being struck with a spell that missed its target. SPOTLIGHT AN ADVERSARY Heroes are molded when pitted against adversaries of equal mettle—this move allows your adversaries to act meaningfully in a scene. When you make this move, an adversary can move anywhere within Close range and perform an action. In battle, this often manifests as an attack—they move into Melee range with a PC, make an attack roll, and showcase their power whether the attack succeeds or fails. But this move isn’t limited to violence. When you spotlight an adversary, they can demonstrate their tactics, reveal their motives, use one of their actions, or change the scene in an interesting way. Whether an adversary bludgeons a PC with jagged maul, floods the room with choking gas, or reveals that a local leader is in their pocket, this move is your chance to prove their prowess. Sometimes, you might want to spotlight more than one adversary during your GM turn. You can spend a Fear to make an additional GM move, shifting the spotlight to another adversary in the scene. You can spend any amount of Fear you currently have to move the spotlight around the battlefield, but you can’t typically spotlight the same adversary more than once during your turn. CAPTURE SOMEONE OR SOMETHING IMPORTANT Taking away something the party desperately wants or needs can quickly ratchet up the tension in a scene. You might knock a weapon from a PC’s hand, capture a fellow party member or an ally of the group, or steal a powerful object from right under their noses. This move is an exciting, fiction-forward way to advance the story. USE A PC’S BACKSTORY AGAINST THEM Integrating a player’s backstory into your move can have a huge impact on the PC and make the story much more personal to them. Maybe someone from their past shows up, a mistake they made long ago catches up with them, or the scene parallels a past experience, giving them the chance to make a different choice. Grounding the move in a character’s history ensures their next decisions matter all the more to them. TAKE AWAY AN OPPORTUNITY PERMANENTLY When things are dire, sometimes the PCs lose an opportunity they once had. A softer version of this move might be to collapse the party’s straightforward pathway through a cave system, forcing them to find another, more treacherous way to escape. A harder version of this move would be to kill a valuable NPC or destroy a powerful object the party desperately needs. These moves can be used to great effect when you want to twist the trajectory of the story in a new direction. 153 Chapter 3: Core GM Mechanics"

GAINING FEAR When you start a campaign, you begin with an amount of Fear equal to the number of PCs. Whenever a PC rolls with Fear, you gain a Fear. You can also gain Fear from the players taking downtime, certain PC abilities or spells, and specific adversary features. You can hold up to a maximum of 12 Fear. TRACKING FEAR You can track Fear with tokens, a die, or any other counting method, and you should keep this pool visible to players during the game. Fear carries over between sessions, so note how many Fear you have at the end of each session and begin the next time with that same pool. SPENDING FEAR Whenever you spend Fear, describe how fate changes the world against the characters. What interrupts or counters the PCs? How does an adversary prepare for a powerful attack? What barrages the PCs’ senses as the raging avalanche swallows them? When you spend a Fear, you can: → Interrupt the players to make a move. → Make an additional GM move. → Use an adversary’s Fear Feature. → Use an environment’s Fear Feature. → Add an adversary’s Experience to a roll. Tip: As with any GM move, spending Fear shouldn’t undermine the players’ fun. Fear is a tool for you to enhance the scene, create dramatic tension, and raise the stakes, not to shut down a PC’s heroic actions. Interrupt the Players to Make a Move You can spend a Fear to make a GM move as if the PCs had failed an action or rolled with Fear, allowing you to interrupt between the players’ moves. This tactic is most useful when you want to make a move during a slew of successes—for example, if the PCs roll a success with Hope four times in a row during combat and you want to give your adversaries a chance to fight back, you can spend a Fear to interrupt the action and spotlight an adversary. Make an Additional GM Move After making a GM move, you can spend a Fear to make an additional move this GM turn. For example, when a player rolls a failure or rolls with Fear, you might spotlight an adversary to show them stealing the party’s carriage and starting to ride away, then spend a Fear to have the archer in the tree shoot at the PCs as cover fire for the carriage heist. Use an Adversary’s Fear Feature In addition to each adversary’s standard features, some adversaries have powerful Fear Features. You can use an adversary’s Fear Features by spending the indicated number of Fear. You can always improvise a Fear Feature for an adversary, even if they already have predetermined Fear Features. Just spend a Fear and come up with a big adversary move that might otherwise feel overpowered or arbitrary (see the upcoming “Improvising Fear Moves” section). If you’ve spent Fear to make an additional GM move to activate an adversary, you must additionally spend the required amount to activate a Fear Feature. For example, once the thief steals the party’s carriage and you’ve spent a Fear to have the archer rain down a hail of arrows, you could spend an additional Fear to activate a third thief in the scene. If this thief has a Fear Feature you want to activate, you would spend a fourth Fear to utilize it. Use an Environment’s Fear Feature Environments can have their own features that require spending Fear to activate. You can use an environment’s Fear Feature by spending the indicated number of Fear. Even if an environment has predetermined Fear Features, you can also spend Fear to improvise a big environment move that might otherwise feel overpowered or arbitrary. Add an Adversary’s Experience to a Roll When making a roll for an adversary, if their Experience would apply to the situation at hand, you can spend a Fear and add the Experience’s modifier to the roll. When you do, showcase how their Experience enhances the action to help ground this mechanic in the narrative. 154 Chapter 3: Core GM Mechanics"

Spending Fear is one of the GM’s strongest tools for inflicting consequences and enhancing the stakes of a scene. Each scene plays a specific role in the story, and not all scenes need the same level of drama and danger. The more important a scene is to the story, the more likely a GM is to want to use Fear to complicate the PCs’ lives and add to the danger of the fiction. The GM adjusts the stakes by increasing or decreasing the amount of Fear they spend in a scene—more Fear to heighten the tension, fewer Fear to ease off. You might surprise the PCs by spending Fear to add twists to a scene to keep the players on their toes, turning what the PCs thought was an incidental or minor scene into one with major stakes. You might spend a few Fear at the beginning of a scene to establish the danger of a story beat and force the PCs to dig deep and overcome it, then either spend additional Fear as you gain it or store it for a future scene. Here is a rough guide of how much Fear you might want to spend in a given scene depending on its role in the story: Scene Type Example Scenes Amount of Fear Spent Incidental A catch-up between PCs after an emotionally charged scene; gathering information; resupplying at a local market; resting during downtime. 0–1 Fear Minor A travel sequence; a minor skirmish that introduces new foes or signals future trouble. 1–3 Fear Standard A substantial battle with a notable objective; perilous travel that tests might and wit; a tense social encounter seeking crucial information or aid. 2–4 Fear Major A large battle with a Solo or Leader adversary; a character-defining scene with a significant change to a character’s personal story (such as revelation, growth, and betrayal). 4–8 Fear Climactic A major confrontation with the villain of a story arc; an epic set piece battle; a judicial duel to determine an important NPC’s fate. 6–12 Fear What Do I Do with All This Fear? If you find yourself coming into a battle with a large amount of Fear (especially over 10), consider the following approaches: Act First Spend a Fear immediately to interrupt the PCs and spotlight an adversary to begin the fight. Spend Consistently Each time your turn comes around, make a GM move, then spend a Fear to make an additional move. If you gained Fear from a PC’s roll, consider spending that one as well, either on an additional GM move or a Fear Feature. Your pool of Fear will slowly deplete, but this method will provide significant power every time play returns to you. Come Out Strong You might choose to spend enough Fear to spotlight a majority of the adversaries during your first GM turn. This is a big move that can put the PCs on the back foot at the beginning of the fight, giving them the opportunity to feel like they’re turning the fight around. Draw Blood Every time an adversary misses an attack, you might spend a Fear to spotlight additional adversaries until one of them successfully strikes a PC. This can help make your GM turn feel dynamic even when your first attack misses. 155 Chapter 3: Core GM Mechanics"

You can always improvise a GM move, but there might be situations where you want to make an especially hard move. In those situations, you can make a Fear move. By spending Fear when you declare the move, you communicate and respect the scale of the action you’re taking. A Fear move should redefine a scene, change the terms, raise the stakes, modify or move the location, or accomplish another pivotal action. Fear moves commonly include one or more of these elements: • Introducing new adversaries to a scene when their appearance hasn’t been foreshadowed or lacks context. • An adversary activating a powerful spell or transformation to deal massive damage or boost their capabilities. • An environment exerting a strong negative effect on the party. For additional guidance on creating Fear moves, reference the existing Fear moves included in the “Adversary Features” and “Environment Features” sections and stat blocks of chapter 4. Examples of Improvised Fear Moves Example 1: The party has confronted a corrupt noble who the GM, Stella, planned to use as a recurring villain, but most of the noble’s HP are already marked and the party is close to dispatching them before their plans can be revealed. Deciding that they don’t want to change plans and let the PCs claim this unexpected victory, Stella improvises a Fear move to allow the noble to escape using a method that makes sense for the adversary but hasn’t been set up in the fiction yet. The noble, not previously shown to use magic, produces a token that allows them to teleport away. The GM has spent a Fear on an improvised “Take away an opportunity” move, and the villain survives to fight another day. Example 2: In a battle with the party, a Solo adversary’s damage output isn’t proving as much of a threat as Stella would have liked. She might decide to spend Fear and improvise an adversary feature where the enemy flies into a rage, increasing their damage for the remainder of the scene. Stella leads with the fiction, describing the enemy’s increasing desperation due to their significant wounds, then signals the mechanical escalation to the PCs—the enemy’s damage output will be much higher from here on out. Example 3: During a scene where Quinn’s druid is tracking a kidnapper, Shepherd rolls a success with Fear. Stella invites Quinn to describe how their action allows the PCs to gain ground, then spends a Fear and describes a huge shadow passing over the group as they spot the kidnapper on the horizon—a Wyvern is on the hunt for flesh. Stella hadn’t mentioned anything about Wyverns being active in this area, so she decides it’s appropriate to spend a Fear rather than introduce the new threat with a normal GM move in response to the player’s roll. Example 4: The party is facing off with a group of bandits trying to steal a treasure chest the group is transporting. Tabby, the warrior, just succeeded on an attack roll with Fear against one of their adversaries. Because Tabby rolled with Fear, play passes to the GM after Tabby deals damage. Stella has 10 Fear in her pool and decides to spend three to start the battle off strong. On the battlefield, there are two ribbet Bandits and a group of five Bandit Minions. Stella uses her move to spotlight the first Bandit, describing her leaping down from a tree to slide beneath the party’s wagon and break some of the wooden floorboards to get to the treasure inside. Stella then spends a Fear to spotlight the second Bandit, a large, bullfrog-like figure with heavy armor. They leap down to put themselves between a few members of the party and swing a massive hammer, using their “Better Surrounded” action to hit all targets in range of their weapon. Stella rolls against the PCs’ Evasion and succeeds. They then roll the adversary’s damage dice and deal 12 physical damage to each target. Finally, Stella spends 2 Fear, the first to shift the spotlight to one of the Bandit Minions, and the second to use their “Group Attack” action (which costs a Fear to activate). This puts the spotlight on all five Minions, who move into Melee range of Tabby. Stella makes an attack, describing the scene and rolling against Tabby’s Evasion. Stella succeeds, so the bandits deals 3 damage each for a total of 15 damage to Tabby. Tabby has no Armor Slots left, so she takes Major damage—marking 2 Hit Points. Stella has 7 Fear left but no more adversaries to spotlight, so Stella returns play to the PCs. 156 Chapter 3: Core GM Mechanics"

Setting a target number for Difficulty can feel like it relies on a lot of factors, but it’s best not to overcomplicate the question: how hard is the task they’re trying to accomplish in this scene? Use the following rubric as a general guideline when setting Difficulty. VERY EASY EASY AVERAGE HARD VERY HARD NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE 5 30 25 20 15 10 Difficulty doesn’t need to be a multiple of 5, so feel free to choose numbers between two of the rubric options. Additionally, while most Difficulties fall between 5 and 30, you can select numbers outside that range to fit the story. You can choose to keep this Difficulty secret or tell the player what they’re aiming for up front; both playstyles work well in Daggerheart. DEGREES OF SUCCESS AND FAILURE Often, instead of setting a single value for success, you might instead give a player different outcomes based on the relative success or failure of their roll This tactic is especially useful on rolls to inspect an area, recall something from the past, or persuade an NPC to surrender information. Simply pick a target number and scale the amount of information you give them up or down based on the player’s relative roll result. DIFFICULTY ROLLS When a PC rolls against an adversary, the stat block provides a Difficulty for the roll. However, if an NPC doesn’t have a stat block—or if you like the unpredictability of rolling— you can have that NPC make a roll to determine what the Difficulty would be. Though this can add to the time it takes to resolve the scene, it can also be a useful tool in situations where you’re unsure what the Difficulty should be. To make a Difficulty Roll, roll a d20 and add any relevant Experience the NPC or adversary has to its total. Tip: Attack rolls against adversaries use that stat block’s assigned Difficulty. For other PC action rolls, it’s often easiest to add the relevant Experience to the adversary’s current Difficulty to determine the new Difficulty. 157 Chapter 3: Core GM Mechanics"

This tool explicitly shows a player that the situation is helpful or harmful to the action they’re attempting. For example, if a player is attempting to sprint through deep mud or knee-high water, you might impose disadvantage on their Agility Roll. If they say something clever to a guard or use knowledge they obtained from an NPC about their captor, you might grant advantage on their Presence Roll. NPC ADVANTAGE AND DISADVANTAGE If an NPC has advantage, roll an extra d20 and take the highest result. Similarly, if an NPC has disadvantage, roll an extra d20 and use the lowest result. Some PC abilities can impose disadvantage on an NPC’s roll, or you might choose to give an NPC advantage or disadvantage due to the circumstances of the narrative. ADVANTAGE VS. DIFFICULTY Because you control both Difficulty and advantage or disadvantage, why not just raise or lower the Difficulty of a roll instead? You certainly can, but advantage and disadvantage allow the characters’ actions and circumstances to modify how successful they are at interacting with the world in a tangible way. Players feel the advantage through rolling extra dice, while a disadvantage conveys a difficult situation on both a mechanical and narrative level. Example: “For any standard adventurer, it would be a Difficulty of 15 to sneak by the Head Guard without being noticed. But, because you knocked out one of their lackeys and stole their attire, you gain advantage on a Presence Roll to sneak by them without catching their eye.” ADVERSARY ROLLS Adversaries aren’t limited to just the attacks and unique actions in their stat blocks; those represent their special abilities, but they can do most anything a PC would do, such as picking a lock or climbing a cliff. However, other than the attack rolls described in the next section, adversaries don’t typically make action rolls. When you want an adversary’s action to have a chance of failure, you can offer the PCs the opportunity to make a reaction roll or otherwise respond to the situation. This highlights the agency of the PCs and keeps the story focused on them. For example, when a Kraken attacks the party’s boat to throw them into the sea, you might have the PCs all make a Strength or Agility Reaction Roll to see if they’re able to keep themselves from falling overboard. For dramatic or difficult tasks that the PCs can’t influence, you might want to roll to see if the adversary succeeds. To do so, spend a Fear to utilize any relevant Experience the adversary might have, then roll a d20. These rolls are more interesting if you tell the players the Difficulty and roll where they can see the result. ADVERSARY ATTACK ROLLS When an adversary you’re controlling attacks a PC, you’ll make a simplified version of the attack roll made by players. Every adversary can make normal attacks using the weapon in their stat block, and some adversaries can also use special moves to attack. Step 1: Choose Dice You make your attack roll with a d20. If the adversary has advantage or disadvantage on the attack, add an extra d20 to that roll. Step 2: Find the Attack Modifier Unlike PCs, adversaries don’t use traits on their attacks; instead, the stat block’s Attack Modifier is the value added to or subtracted from the adversary’s attack roll. You can also spend a Fear to add an adversary’s Experience to the roll’s result. Set aside a number of character tokens equal to the Attack Modifier and any applicable Experience you have spent Fear to add. Step 3: Roll the Dice Once you’ve gathered your dice and tokens for the Attack Modifier, roll them all at the same time. Counting each token as 1 (or −1 for a negative modifier), add the tokens and dice roll result together to determine the total. If you rolled with advantage (or disadvantage), don’t count both d20s, only the highest (or lowest) one. Step 4: Resolve the Situation Share your roll total with the player who was attacked and compare it against their Evasion. If the attack meets or beats that value, it is successful and deals the damage indicated in the stat block for that attack. If it rolls below their Evasion, the attack misses and no damage is dealt; invite the player to describe how they avoided the blow. 160 Chapter 3: Core GM Mechanics"

If it rolls below their Evasion, the attack misses and no damage is dealt; invite the player to describe how they avoided the blow. 160 Chapter 3: Core GM Mechanics\n-- 161 of 415 --\nAttacking Multiple Targets By default, an adversary can only hit one target with their standard attack. When an adversary’s action lets you make an attack against multiple targets, you make one attack roll and ask if it hits any of the targets. If you are making individual attacks with multiple adversaries during the same GM move, make an attack roll for each adversary. Attack Rolls as Story Every attack roll is an opportunity for you to show how that attack changes the scene. When your attack roll hits, you’re taking away resources from the PCs (Hit Points, Stress, Armor Slots, etc.), so ensure you provide context for that depletion in the fiction. When your roll is a failure, it’s an opportunity to celebrate the prowess of the PC and ask the player to describe how their character avoids the attack. If a player isn’t sure how to describe their Evasion, remind them it’s not just about how quick a character is, it’s about how skilled they are at not getting hit. This could manifest as the sorcerer reaching out and stopping an arrow mid-flight or the wizard throwing up a magical barrier. It could be the rogue transforming into a swirling mass of darkness and letting the axe pass through them, a ranger backflipping out of the way, or anything else that aligns with the character they built. ADVERSARY REACTION ROLLS Some PC moves can force an adversary or other NPC to make a reaction roll. When this occurs, roll a d20 to determine whether they succeed or fail. If you meet or exceed the roll’s Difficulty, the NPC succeeds and avoids the consequences. If they roll below the target number, the NPC fails and suffers the consequences. Because NPCs don’t have character traits like PCs do, you can spend a Fear to add any of the adversary’s relevant Experiences as a bonus to their reaction roll. Example: Rune is chasing a Masked Thief and unleashes the Fireball spell to slow them down. The Masked Thief has the very relevant Experience of Acrobatics +3, so the GM spends a Fear and adds +3 to the reaction roll. On the other hand, if you feel like the adversary would be particularly weak against the PC’s move, you can instead impose a penalty on the adversary’s roll. Example: Rune the wizard casts Fireball on a Zombie Pack and their commander, a Skeleton Knight. The Difficulty on the reaction roll is 13. The GM rules that a Zombie Pack is particularly ill-prepared to avoid a fireball, as they’re weak against fire and unlikely to dodge quickly, so the GM imposes a −3 penalty on the roll. The GM rolls a d20 for the Zombie Pack and gets a 13. With the −3 penalty, they fail and take full damage. The GM rolls again for the Skeleton Knight and gets an 18, which passes the reaction roll. The Skeleton Knight takes half damage per the mechanics of the Fireball spell. CLASS HOPE FEATURES Each class has a Hope Feature that requires 3 Hope to use; whenever a PC uses this unique and powerful feature, ensure that it impacts the scene. Draw attention to the ferocity and strength of the druid’s empowered Beastform, encourage the guardian to describe their burning determination as they patch their armor and fight on—these are your heroes’ powerful features, so yield the stage to the player to affect the fiction and describe how their PC’s Hope changes fate. 161 Chapter 3: Core GM Mechanics"

Some stat blocks and adventures specifically call for a countdown, but feel free to use them in any scene you wish. COUNTDOWN DIE When you want to represent the passage of time or events leading to a dramatic climax—such as an impending adversary move or a significant narrative event—you can use your d20 or another die as a countdown die to track that progression. Choose a die with your desired starting value on it and put it on the table with that number facing up. For example, if your starting value is 5, you can use a d6 set to 5 as your countdown die. Each time the countdown ticks down, turn the die to reduce its value by one. When the countdown ticks down from 1 to 0 (which doesn’t appear on the die), the countdown ends and triggers the event you were counting down to. If you ever need to continue a countdown across sessions, record the current countdown value so you can continue counting next session. If you don’t want to use dice to track your countdowns, you can alternatively draw a number of small boxes equal to the starting value and fill them in as the countdown progresses. USING A COUNTDOWN When you introduce a countdown, you can either directly tell the players you’ve done so (“I’m starting a countdown to when the army attacks—what do you want to do before then?”) or imply it through your narration (“The bridge is starting to crack, and it won’t last long.”). It’s up to you whether you keep the countdown die visible to the players (increasing the tension each time it ticks down) or secretly use it to track an event they can’t predict. When you’re designing a countdown (or using one from an adversary stat block), consider three elements: • Activation: What moment in the fiction prompts you to activate the countdown? For example, a countdown might activate when the PCs stealthily enter an enemy camp. • Advancement: When does the countdown advance, prompting you to tick down the die by 1? For example, a countdown might advance whenever a PC makes an action roll, or it might advance only on certain roll results. • Effect: What happens when the countdown ends? For example, a countdown might trigger a powerful enemy attack or a wave of allies arriving to save the day. STANDARD COUNTDOWN Many adversaries and events use a standard countdown, in which the die begins on a specific number (such as “Countdown 4”) and ticks down every time a player makes an action roll, regardless of the result. When the countdown die reaches 0, the countdown’s effect triggers immediately after the last action roll is resolved. • Short countdowns (2–4) work well when you want a move or event to quickly trigger in an encounter regardless of how the players roll. If you want the countdown speed to vary with the players’ rolls, see the following “Dynamic Countdowns” section. • Longer countdowns (5 or higher) are best used for powerful moves or events that you want to build across the length of an entire scene. While in combat, standard countdowns for adversary moves are usually reserved for the major antagonist. Running multiple countdowns at once can be complex, so most encounters include no more than one adversary with countdowns. DYNAMIC COUNTDOWN When a situation is being actively influenced by the players, you may choose to use a dynamic countdown to track it. Unlike standard countdowns, this doesn’t tick down every time a player rolls—instead, it’s influenced by the outcome of their rolls or choices. Dynamic countdowns can be used to track larger-scale events or situations happening in the background of a complex scene. Typically, these countdowns have a starting value of 5–10. For example, if the PCs are trying to destroy a wall or another object that doesn’t have Hit Points, a dynamic countdown can track how close they are to destroying it. Similarly, if the party’s skyship is under attack, you could use a dynamic countdown to track their escape. If the PCs are chasing or searching for an enemy, the countdown can track how close the PCs are to catching them. Most dynamic countdowns can be categorized as either a progress countdown (if players are working toward a desired outcome) or a consequence countdown (if players are trying to avoid a dreaded outcome). The Dynamic Countdown Advancement table suggests how much to tick down the countdown die each time a PC makes an action roll. 162 Chapter 3: Core GM Mechanics"

Randomized Starting Value Instead of assigning a starting value, a countdown might instead use a randomized value. For example, a “Countdown (1d6)” means that you roll 1d6 and use the result as the countdown’s starting value. Randomized countdowns are most commonly used when you want the timing to be unpredictable—usually to keep the PCs on their toes. Loop Some countdowns loop after they trigger; this is common with adversaries who can recharge a feature over time. After this type of countdown triggers and you apply its effects, it resets to its starting value and begins counting down again. For example, “Countdown (Loop 5)” resets after 5 ticks. Increasing or Decreasing Some countdowns repeat like loops, but the starting value, and thus the timing between them, increases or decreases with each loop, reflecting a narrative event that changes frequency. Each time an increasing countdown triggers and resets, its starting value increases by 1. For example, “Countdown (Increasing 8)” begins at 8, then after its effect triggers, the starting value resets to 9, then 10, and so on. Similarly, each time a decreasing countdown triggers, its starting value decreases by 1. For example, “Countdown (Decreasing 8)” begins at 8, then resets to 7, then 6, and so on. Once a decreasing countdown reaches 0, a major event triggers—maybe a cave the PCs are struggling to escape from finally collapses, or a ship they’re trying to keep afloat sinks beneath the waves. CHASE COUNTDOWNS You can use dynamic countdowns to track the progress of a chase scene, whether the PCs are pursuing an NPC or being pursued themselves. When the chase begins, set two countdowns: one for the pursuing party and one for the escaping party. First pick a die for the pursuers’ countdown— the more time you want the chase to take, the higher the starting value should be—then set that die at its highest value. Next, select another die with the same starting value for the escapee’s countdown, but set that die at a lower value to reflect how much of a lead they have (1 lower for a small lead, 3 lower for a decent lead, 5 lower for a substantial lead). For example, a chase through a town market could use d6 dice and each tick of the countdown could represent one range band (Very Close to Close, Close to Far, Far to Very Far, etc.). For a chase playing out over a longer distance, such as the PCs pursuing bandits across the countryside, each tick on the countdown might represent several miles. Regardless of whether the PCs are pursuing or escaping, their action rolls advance both countdowns, as shown on the earlier Dynamic Countdown Advancement table. When a PC succeeds on an action roll, it ticks down their countdown, which is a progress countdown. When they fail on an action roll—or roll a success with Fear—it ticks down the other party’s countdown, which is a consequence countdown. When setting the Difficulty of these rolls, consider the adversary’s Difficulty plus any other narrative considerations. Example: A thief has stolen Rune’s wizard spellbook and now the PCs are chasing them across a market square. The GM, Stella, decides on a d6 for the pursuing PCs’ progress countdown, then sets up the thief’s countdown—a consequence countdown—by taking another d6 and setting its starting value to 3, since the thief has a slight head start. The warrior, Tabby, asks to go first, clambering up onto the market stall tents to run over the top rather than pushing through the crowds. Stella calls for an Agility Roll against the thief’s Difficulty of 15, and Aliyah uses Tabby’s Second-Story Traveler Experience to get a bonus. Quinn spends a Hope to Help an Ally, describing how Shepherd channels their affinity with air to boost Tabby up. With the help of Shepherd’s d6 advantage die, Tabby rolls a success with Hope, so Stella ticks the PC’s progress countdown from 6 to 4; this represents Tabby gaining on the thief and helping the group catch up by calling out a quicker route through the crowd. Next, Rune wants to take things into his own hands. Using his Book of Sitil grimoire, he describes how he conjures an illusion of a runaway horse charging across the thief’s path, forcing them to slow down rather than get trampled. Rune makes a Spellcast Roll against Difficulty 15, but rolls a failure with Fear. Stella describes the thief seeing through the illusion at the last moment and ducks through a busy crowd that blocks the party’s path. Stella ticks the thief’s consequence countdown down from 3 to 1 as the thief makes it to Far range away from the party. The thief is eluding their sight and in real danger of getting away—if the consequence countdown ticks down one more time, the thief will be gone. 163 Chapter 3: Core GM Mechanics"

While you can use a die for long-term countdowns, it’s often easier to make a countdown track to record progress across multiple sessions. To do so, decide how far out the event should be (usually between 4 and 12 ticks) and, on a piece of paper, create small boxes for each tick. Starting from the first and working towards the last, write some events that may occur along the way that foreshadow the final event. These steps can alternate between softer and harder moves to give a sense of variety and growing tension. Adding unique events throughout the story ensures the countdown is always present during play, even if the final result is many sessions away. Advancing a Long-Term Countdown During a short rest, you should generally tick a relevant long-term countdown once. During a long rest, you should generally tick down a relevant long-term countdown twice. When you tick the countdown, let the consequences ripple down to the PCs, building tension as events unfold. Often, you can reveal this progression through something the PCs witness, such as the banner of a rival leader recently hung on the castle or conversations in the marketplace about the strange lights NPCs saw in the sky last night. Other times, you might cinematically cut away to a scene the PCs are unaware of, narrating the events to the players. This is best done when the characters know about the events surrounding the countdown so players aren’t asked to completely ignore out-of-character knowledge. Example Long-Term Countdown Early in the campaign, the party crossed paths with Marius, a galapa mercenary captain. The group suspected Marius would cause trouble, but pressing matters drew them elsewhere in the kingdom. Meanwhile, Marius makes a deal with an expansionist theocracy to the east—an action the party’s seraph may well view with concern because of her past with the theocracy. In exchange for helping the theocrats invade, Marius will be appointed as governor of a prosperous county once the kingdom falls. The GM wants this invasion to ramp up pretty quickly, so they set the countdown’s starting value to 8, drawing eight checkboxes as a countdown tracker. Next to each checkbox, the GM plans out story beats that represent the countdown’s advancement. EXAMPLE: COUNTDOWN TRACKER 8 The deal is struck and Marius’s company mobilizes. 7 Marius’s company raids a border town. 6 The theocracy’s troops gather at the border.* 5 Marius’s company captures a different border town, having misdirected nearby militias. 4 The theocracy’s army marches into the kingdom, establishing a beachhead in the captured town. 3 Refugees flee the region around the border town, bringing news of the invasion with them to larger settlements.* 2 Marius harries the kingdom’s army to give the theocracy time to establish supply lines. 1 The theocracy rededicates a temple in the captured town to their god, magnifying their priests’ power in the kingdom. 0 The invasion becomes an all-out war, with Marius’s and the theocracy’s army executing coordinated strikes to divide the kingdom’s defenders. The GM identifies steps 6 and 3, marked with *, as prime candidates for steps where news would reach the party. This gives the PCs at least two clear prompts to get involved before the invasion escalates to a full-blown war. Depending on the party’s movements and location as the countdown progresses, the GM can bring the edges of the invasion to the party’s horizon—or their doorstep. 164 Chapter 3: Core GM Mechanics"

Your players might operate as a band of thieves who rob their adversaries, a group of spiritual devotees who abstain from acquiring possessions, or a company of adventurers whose approach to wealth and possessions lands somewhere in the middle. You can also utilize wealth and equipment to adjust the dial between realism and fantasy. If your game has a more survivalist tone and players need gold to buy food, their interactions with opportunities to acquire wealth will be very different than if you handwave the cost of rations. DISTRIBUTING GOLD Using gold as a quest reward can give your players a fun way to procure new equipment for future adventures. This book leaves the price of items up to you, allowing you to decide how much importance you want to place on gold in your campaign and how costly individual items are if and when they become available. If you don’t want to worry about gold in your campaign, you can let PCs shop by abstracting payment and letting each player choose one or two items. When you do this, rather than letting them choose from every item, you can encourage them to shop around by only offering a few items that make sense for that location, have bonuses and abilities you want to make available, or fit your party’s tastes and goals. If you’d rather gold play a larger role in your game, the following sections provide further guidance on pricing equipment. DISTRIBUTING EQUIPMENT At character creation, players can choose from the starting weapons and armor. The remainder of the equipment is organized by rarity and should be made available to players as the party journeys through the campaign. For example, you can stock a few options in shops along the PCs’ journey, provide equipment as part of an NPC’s reward, or allow them to pull weapons and armor off of the adversaries they’ve defeated. The average costs of items and services can be found on the Average Costs table in the upcoming “Economy of Your World” section. You can raise the price of weapons and armor with unique magical qualities or worldbuilding implications. For example, armor the PCs can use to disguise themselves or an enchanted sword that has been outlawed in a specific region will fetch a higher price. Regardless of how you treat the overall economy in your campaign, keep in mind how common a weapon or armor is in a particular city or region—and how generous or stingy a particular shopkeeper might be. DISTRIBUTING LOOT The tables of items and consumables in chapter 2 are organized to help you distribute loot based on its prevalence and impact. The lower the number of an item or consumable on a list, the less it tends to impact play and the more commonly it can be found in a typical fantasy economy. Consumables are fun to use and less powerful than permanent items, so you can offer common consumables pretty regularly during a campaign. Outside of buying them from shops along the way, you might consider having an NPC offer a bundle of consumables as a gesture of good faith to get in the PCs’ good graces, or scattering a few around an enemy camp for the PCs to pick up as they sneak through. When the campaign nears its climax or you want to highlight an important moment, you might find a narrative reason to give the PCs a few rare or legendary consumables and items. You’re highly encouraged to make your own items and consumables for your campaign to personalize it for your story. Like other equipment, loot has no set gold cost; instead, the cost should reflect how often you’re giving gold as a reward, as well as how commonplace that loot might be locally. ECONOMY OF YOUR WORLD The following table provides examples of the average cost of basic goods and services. However, your world’s economy should reflect how important gold is to your campaign, so don’t be afraid to adjust these prices accordingly. Average Costs Purchase Gold Meals for a party of adventurers per night 1 Handful Standard inn room per night 1 Handful Luxury inn room per night 1 Bag Carriage ride 2 Handfuls Mount (horse, mule, etc.) 3 Bags Specialized tools 3 Handfuls Fine clothing 3 Handfuls Luxury clothing 1 Bag Tier 1 equipment (weapons, armor) 1–5 Handfuls Tier 2 equipment (weapons, armor) 1–2 Bags Tier 3 equipment (weapons, armor) 5–10 Bags Tier 4 equipment (weapons, armor) 1–2 Chests 165 Chapter 3: Gold, Equipment and Loot"

Differentiate each character by the unique ways they speak and act—you can use a new voice, posture, or set of mannerisms if you’re comfortable—and lean into their individual motives to fill the world with dynamic, active NPCs. CHOOSING NPC STATISTICS Many NPCs don’t need page-long backstories or their own stat block—if the PCs are simply interacting with a friendly bar patron to gather information, you probably just need a name, description, and motive. These three things give the NPC a moniker, a way to recognize them, and a purpose behind their actions. If they’re someone the PCs might try to make a roll against, consider also giving them a Difficulty. You can use the examples in the earlier “Setting Roll Difficulty” section or base it on similar NPCs you’ve already introduced. If you’re improvising a creature who isn’t interacting with the party socially, it’s still important to think about motive, but you’ll want to focus more on the information needed to play them in battle. You can grab an adversary stat block of a similar creature and make some changes—or if you prefer, improvise your own using the guidance in the “Improvising Adversaries” section of chapter 4, then decide their features when you have the chance to make a GM move. That allows you to choose something that will have the most interesting impact on the scene at that moment. USING NPC ALLIES NPCs can also become allies in a fight. If this happens, you don’t need a stat block for them—instead, put the spotlight on them and what they do, showing how the fiction changes because they’re involved. When they act to help the PCs, and if a PC capitalizes on that help during their next action, give the PC advantage on the roll. Even if an NPC doesn’t have Hit Points or Stress, they aren’t immune to danger and tragedy—they can get seriously injured or even die as a result of the narrative. During your GM move, don’t be afraid to capture and threaten the NPC to drive the PCs to action, trap the NPC and force the PCs to make a difficult choice, or push on the NPC’s motive so hard that they do something that endangers everyone. When it’s justified, hit the NPC hard. Allow them to be beaten and broken after a difficult fight, or have them die in the party’s arms if the narrative says they should. You run both the adversaries and NPCs—you control their story and fate. Follow the fiction, embrace your GM principles, and make moves that drive interesting conflict for the party. 166 Chapter 3: Running GM NPCs"

Follow the fiction, embrace your GM principles, and make moves that drive interesting conflict for the party. 166 Chapter 3: Running GM NPCs\n-- 167 of 415 --\nNPC FEATURES If you want an important NPC to mechanically interact with the system, you can give them one or more features that reflect how they move through the world. At your discretion, you can share these NPC features openly with your table, allowing players to help keep track of them, or keep them private, so an NPC’s actions feel more organic and narrative-focused. An NPC feature works similarly to an adversary’s reaction, but it is broken down into the trigger and the effect. The trigger is the event that makes the NPC behave in a certain way, and the effect is what mechanically occurs because of that trigger. For example: Not On My Watch Trigger: A PC within Very Close range marks at least 2 Hit Points. Effect: Roll 1d8. On a 4 or higher, this NPC moves into Melee range of the PC and marks one of the Hit Points instead. Reduce the die size by 1 (from 1d8 to 1d6, then 1d6 to 1d4). Once you must reduce the die below 1d4, this feature can’t be used again until this NPC finishes a long rest. In this example, any PCs within the NPC’s Very Close range have a chance of taking less damage because of the ally, but if they do, the odds of that NPC being able to reduce damage again decrease. Once the NPC can no longer trigger the effect, they can’t use that feature until they rest and recover. These triggers and effects are designed so you can include other mechanics alongside them—such as countdowns, rolling dice, and dealing damage—to represent an NPC’s complex and dynamic interactions with the world. On the flip side, you can also tailor these elements to be as narrative- forward as needed for your playstyle and table. Optionally, an NPC might also have a choice. The choice represents a specific parameter by which the trigger and effect will operate. For example: Arcane Hold Choice: When the battle begins, choose a favored PC. Trigger: The first time during a battle the favored PC is within Close range and hit with an attack. Effect: Make an attack roll with a +6 modifier against the adversary. On a success, the target is temporarily Restrained by tendrils of powerful magic. The following NPC feature examples showcase the different ways you can approach this mechanic. Use them as inspiration to build your own for NPCs in your campaign. If the effect ever calls for an attack roll or action roll, roll your d20 (just like with adversaries). ADDITIONAL NPC FEATURE EXAMPLES Volley of Arrows Trigger: A battle begins and this NPC is involved. Effect: Activate a countdown (Loop 3). It ticks down when a PC misses an attack. When it triggers, this NPC releases a volley of arrows at a target of the PCs’ choice, dealing 2d8+3 physical damage. Mentor Choice: When the battle begins, choose a protégé PC. Trigger: Your protégé is within Close range and fails an attack roll. Effect: Move into Melee range with the PC and give them advice or guidance. The next attack roll they make has advantage. Regroup Choice: When a battle begins, choose a point within Far range. Trigger: All PCs have marked all of their Armor Slots. Effect: Teleport all PCs and this NPC to the chosen spot and clear an Armor Slot on each target. Into the Night Trigger: The PCs start a long rest with this NPC. Effect: Roll 1d4. On a 2 or less, this NPC steals 1 handful of gold from the party while they are sleeping, then disappears into the night. It’s good practice to limit the number of active NPCs with features, as they can quickly become overwhelming to track, especially in battle. We recommended using them only as needed, prioritizing very important or reoccuring NPCs. 167 Chapter 3: Running GM NPCs"

FATE ROLLS When narrating a moment outside the PCs’ influence, the GM might wish to leave the outcome up to chance. In these situations, you can use a fate roll, asking a player to roll only their Hope or Fear Die to decide the result. Your choice of die doesn’t affect the outcome, nor does the roll result grant Hope or Fear—the die type simply helps add flavor to the roll. You might roll the Hope Die in lucky circumstances or to see if fortune smiles upon the character, while the Fear Die can be used to decide whether a hazard comes into play or how dangerous a situation becomes. When making a fate roll, you can declare what event occurs if the result falls within a certain number range or determine the outcome based on how high or low the result is. “Roll your Fear Die. On a 4 or lower, the fire spreads beyond this house.” “I think it’s really up to chance whether reinforcements will make it to you in time. Go ahead and roll your Fear Die— that’ll determine the starting size of the countdown. When that triggers, reinforcements will arrive in your Far range.” “Go ahead and roll your Hope Die to see how big the crowd at the inn is tonight. The higher the roll, the bigger the crowd.” “Make a roll using your Hope Die to determine the number of Stamina Potions the shop has in stock.” FALLING AND COLLISION DAMAGE If a character falls to the ground, you can use the following as a guide to determine the damage they take: • A fall from Very Close range deals 1d10+3 physical damage. • A fall from Close range deals 1d20+5 physical damage. • A fall from Far or Very Far range deals 1d100+15 physical damage, or death at the GM’s discretion. If a character collides with an object or another character at a dangerous speed, they take 1d20+5 direct physical damage. You can always increase or decrease the damage dice to fit the story. MOVING AND FIGHTING UNDERWATER Attack rolls underwater have disadvantage unless it makes sense for a character to easily fight underwater, like a Siren or Shark making an attack on a PC. For any creatures that can’t breathe underwater, you can use a countdown to create tension about how long they can hold their breath. Set the countdown die’s starting value to 3 or higher and tick down as follows: • Tick down once whenever any PC takes an action underwater. • If an action roll is a failure or with Fear, you can use your move to tick it down an additional time. (If the roll is both a failure and with Fear, you can tick it twice instead.) Once the countdown ends, a PC underwater must mark a Stress whenever they take an action. CONFLICT BETWEEN PCS Sometimes a player might want their character to act against another PC in the scene. Before jumping to rolling dice, discuss the situation with both players to decide how to resolve the conflict. A roll might not be necessary to reach an outcome—but if rolling will be fun for everyone involved, come to a consensus on the terms of the roll, then facilitate the scene according to the results. On an attack roll against a PC, the attacker rolls against the defender’s Evasion, just like an adversary. On any other kind of action roll, the instigator makes an action roll and the target makes a reaction roll. To succeed, the instigator must beat a Difficulty equal to the total value of the reaction roll. 168 Chapter 3: Optional GM Mechanics"

LAYING THE GROUNDWORK If you were creating an epic fantasy TV show, you’d prepare via the preproduction process: the creator and showrunner would build the writers’ room, work with the producers and heads of departments to develop the look, feel, and vision for the series, and so on. If you were writing an epic fantasy book series, you might accomplish this by worldbuilding and developing characters, researching the genre, making a mood board, and outlining the book. Many tabletop roleplaying games do this via a session zero. This term means different things to different people, but for Daggerheart, it’s how you set up your group to tell a successful fantasy epic together. Before making characters or deciding on the setting, the group talks about what everyone wants from this experience. The GM facilitates session zero, but all players should be active participants, advocating for what they do and don’t want from the campaign. There are many tools for structuring your session zero. If everyone in your group has played together before, you may already have a method for conducting this process. If you haven’t done a session zero before or want to explore another process, the following sections offer suggestions. An essential part of session zero is choosing your game’s content and safety tools. These tools ensure players know they can avoid material that would be hurtful or upsetting— and beyond that, safety tools empower players to explore challenging subjects everyone has signed up to engage with (to be what we’d call “comfortably uncomfortable”). In addition, these tools help the GM and players communicate during play. In improvisation, there is always the chance that something unexpectedly troubling comes up, or the participants need help remembering what story elements the group is avoiding or keeping “off-screen.” Safety tools give structure to pregame conversations and tools for working through mid-game hurdles. We recommend the following tools: CATS One of many frameworks for discussing content and safety is the CATS Method. This framework presents four elements to discuss with your players to decide what the group wants from the game: → Concept → Aim → Tone → Subject CONCEPT Discuss the concept for the campaign—what’s the big-picture pitch? If this campaign was a book series, how would you hype it up to a friend you know would love it? Getting yourself and the group excited about a campaign’s concept is a great way to set a guiding star for your creative discussions throughout session zero and beyond. For example, you might pitch one of the following concepts: → Childhood friends reunite at the funeral of their village elder and uncover a secret that could destroy the world…or save it. → A science-fantasy romp across the realms with a party of misfits who try to find their origins but end up finding a family in one another. → In a world wracked by powerful disasters, a group of treasure hunters is hired to retrieve five lost elemental shards to restore the balance of nature. You can also choose a campaign frame from chapter 5 or use those options as inspiration to create your own to share with the group. Alternatively, you can use the campaign frames as a guide to create a new frame together. You might not know the campaign’s concept at the beginning, and that’s okay. Feel free to return to this conversation at the end of session zero or throughout the first couple sessions of play as necessary. AIM Aim is what you want from and for your campaign—your creative and social goals. Do you have a specific creative agenda? Or do you mostly want to spend a few hours with friends every week making things up together and blowing off steam? For example, an aim might center on one of the following: → We’re going to play a weekly campaign from level 1 to 10 with strong individual and group character arcs. → Our aim is mostly to hang out and chat while killing monsters and getting new powers and cool items. → We want to tell a story that explores the relationship between grief and community through an action- fantasy game in a world recovering from a near- apocalypse. Other ways to explore your game’s aim might be to reference touchstones or character archetypes you want to play, drawing from books, films, comics, music, and other media. You might create a mood board to help define the aesthetic of your campaign or a soundtrack to form an aural soundscape for the vibe you want. 169 Chapter 3: Session Zero and Safety Tools"

Even if you’re using an established setting, your version of that setting will become distinct through your collective creativity. An important element of defining your world and campaign is agreeing on tone— the emotional landscape and tendency of the campaign. Establishing your game’s tone helps align the players’ expectations and ensures everyone has a good time. A quick way to pick a tone is to list the following options on a piece of paper or note card, then circle a few everyone is excited to focus on and cross out tones the players want to avoid. A D V E N T U R O U S , C O Z Y , D R A M AT I C , F U N N Y , G O O F Y , G R I T T Y , I N T I M AT E , L I G H T H E A R T E D , P O L I T I C A L , R O M A N T I C , S C A R Y , W H I M S I C A L Example: Emerson, Kate, Chen, and Asa are starting a new Daggerheart campaign. Chen nominates Dramatic to be highlighted and everyone agrees, so that option is circled to signal that it will be prominent in the campaign. Emerson says they’re not interested in a Goofy tone, and nominates it to be crossed out. Kate is possibly interested in Goofy, but since Emerson’s not, Kate is willing to cross it out— but in exchange, she asks that the group consider circling Romantic. Chen isn’t interested in Romantic being a central tone, but doesn’t want to cross it out and completely remove it from play. Asa chimes in and nominates Adventurous for a major tone, and after discussion, it gets circled. The group agrees that they don’t want a Gritty game, so it gets crossed out. They also cross out Whimsical. This leaves the group with the following list: A D V E N T U R O U S , C O Z Y , D R A M AT I C , F U N N Y , G O O F Y , G R I T T Y , I N T I M AT E , L I G H T H E A R T E D , P O L I T I C A L , R O M A N T I C , S C A R Y , W H I M S I C A L In other words, they’re interested in a game that will be especially Adventurous and Dramatic; sometimes Cozy, Funny, Intimate, Lighthearted, Political, Romantic, and Scary; but not Goofy, Gritty, or Whimsical. SUBJECT Discuss subjects you and the players actively want in the game and topics you want to avoid. Subjects to avoid can be broad themes, such as bigotry and torture, or specific elements, such as spiders or a particular name that carries emotional weight for a player. When discussing challenging subjects, it’s important to center the needs and desires of players from marginalized groups who are personally affected by the issues and subject matter that could come up in a given storyline. In heroic fantasy games, some players find it empowering to face oppressive forces as part of the evils of the world—allowing those evils to be directly fought and overcome—but that should be a choice actively made by the players who are impacted by that oppression outside the game. Many marginalized people play TTRPGs to escape the everyday frustrations and pains of bigotry they experience in their daily lives, and they shouldn’t be forced to struggle with them in a game. These choices should be made prioritizing the needs of those most impacted by the subject matter. For instance, if your group includes LGBTQ players, prioritize their preferences on whether to include or exclude homophobia, transphobia, and other forms of oppression against queer people. This is a good time to pick any specific safety tools you want to use during the campaign. We recommend the following to start: LINES AND VEILS “Lines and Veils” are a safety tool designed to be first employed in a session zero and revisited as needed throughout a campaign. When discussing the tones and goals for the game, the GM (or another player) should make a list of everyone’s lines and veils. Lines are topics that players do not want in the game. They should not appear in any form. Veils are topics that players do not want to feature in the game, but can still exist in the world. Treat lines and veils like a living document—the list can be updated by anyone at any point. X-CARD The X-Card is a tool that allows any player (including the GM) to remove content from the game. This traditionally appears in the form of a physical card, marked with a large letter X, that is placed within reach of all players at the table. That said, a table can represent the X-Card through a different item, creating an X with their arms, or using another agreed-upon signal. To utilize the X-Card, a player only needs to tap the card (or use the agreed-upon signal) and note the moment of play they wish to “rewind” to. It can help if the player notes the detail they’re flagging for removal, but this is not a requirement for using the tool. The group will simply go back to the designated moment and play forward, making a new choice.

Regardless of whether you want to use an existing setting or build your own, one of the best ways to ensure that players are invested and excited to play is to encourage them to bring their ideas and interests to the planning stages in session zero. For example, you might ask questions like the following during your session zero conversation: • “Can you talk more about what you mean by wanting to make a post-fantasy world?” • “When you said it’d be cool if elven clans worked like a beehive, did you mean physiology, or is this more about communication and hierarchy?” • “What aspect of that fantasy series you mentioned are you most excited to bring into the game? The plot, the setting, the vibes, or something else?” Fostering an atmosphere of curiosity is also useful for interrogating your own assumptions in worldbuilding. Rather than treating typical fantasy conventions as the default, you can make conscious decisions about your world to intentionally build a setting that best fits the fiction your table wants to create. For example, your group might consider questions like: • “Should all the major countries in our region be monarchies, or do we want them to have different forms of government? If they’re monarchies, are they feudal, bureaucratic, or a different structure entirely?” • “How do people think about gender in this world? Do conceptions of gender vary by community, by region, or something else?” • “What, if anything, do we want to change in the existing setting we’re using to better fit the story we’re telling?” Every group is different and every GM’s style is their own, so use the parts of collaborative worldbuilding that excite you, and feel free to leave behind the aspects that don’t. FINDING CAMPAIGN INSPIRATION During session zero, look for hooks and nuggets of ideas to use as creative inspiration throughout the campaign. This can be things as small as a turn of phrase or the name of a creature or things as big as a player describing a climactic scene they want for their character at the end of the campaign. You’ll especially want to note what the players give as their answers for the background and connections prompts while creating their characters. Those answers will form the bulk of the initial material for you to use to tie the story of the campaign to the characters, especially if you want that story to emerge from those characters’ worlds and lives. You might also choose to frame your questions with additional narrative you think is interesting. If you do, leave space for that player to push back on your additions to their answers and discuss as needed: • “Jasper, how did you get the Crystal of the Sunbearer? And what does it whisper to you at night before you drift off to sleep?” • “The simiah mentioned that his sister settled in a small town. Sprout, what do you think about having that sister be from the town you accidentally destroyed?” Keep your GM principles in mind throughout this process— these apply to all stages of the campaign, not just in-scene play. 171 Chapter 3: Session Zero and Safety Tools"

BEFOREHAND Ahead of the session, you’ll want to prepare materials for the game. This process often differs if you’re playing in person or over a virtual tabletop; for a physical table, you might want to print off documents, but the digital files used during an online game could also be utilized through laptops or tablets. Gather—or have players open digital versions of—character sheets, reference sheets, play guides, maps, notetaking tools, physical dice or online dice rollers, and any other play aids you think you’ll need. Before the players arrive, prepare the physical or VTT play space and make it as comfortable for yourself and the players as you can. PLAYER INTRODUCTIONS (5–10 MIN) If you haven’t all played together before, facilitate introductions as the players arrive and make sure everyone knows what pronouns to use for one another. If all the players already know one another, you can spend this time catching up and settling in. SESSION OVERVIEW (5–10 MIN) Explain to the players what will be involved in this session zero. Point out the materials and explain when they’ll want to use them. Many people find it helpful to browse through materials before using them, but encourage people not to get too far ahead of the discussion. CATS (40 MIN) Discuss what the group wants from the game using CATS or another framework. This includes what the campaign should be about, what you want from the campaign socially and creatively, logistical details (like how often, when, and where you’re going to play), the tone of the game, content to include and exclude, and anything else you need to cover before deciding the setting and making characters. BREAK (5–10 MIN) It’s good to take breaks to let everyone move around, refresh themselves, and get a little bit of time to decompress from creative discussions, which can demand a lot of attention and energy. WORLDBUILDING (50 MIN) Whether you’re using the guidance in the upcoming “Running a Campaign” section, a campaign frame from chapter 5, or your own worldbuilding tools, facilitate the process of creating or fleshing out the setting for your campaign. During the process, think about the elements (tropes, genres, influences) the players are especially interested in, then do what you can to build those elements into the setting. Worldbuilding can be engrossing, but you don’t need to define or name every part of the map at this stage. Leave yourself blank spaces to fill in later as you continue to build the setting together through play. Alternatively, you may instead want to introduce players to a setting you’ve created! Use this time to introduce your setting and answer any questions they may have. BREAK (5–10 MIN) Since character creation is such an important part of preparing a campaign, it’s good to go in fresh. Consider taking another short break between worldbuilding and the next step. CHARACTER CREATION (70 MIN) Walk the group through character creation using the “Character Creation” section of chapter 1 and the “Character Creation” PDF guide, helping players with their questions and facilitating discussion and coordination between players. This step may also include explaining some of the game’s rules so players understand the abilities from class, subclass, heritage, and domain cards. Pay special attention to the group’s discussion of each character’s background and connections, as they will play a vital role in your preparations for the campaign. This is a great place to ask questions and encourage players to flesh out their answers. If time is limited or this process is taking longer than expected, try to at least complete the background questions and make one connection per player. BREAK (5 MIN) If you’ve got time left in your session, you can take a short break before doing wrap-up and feedback, or a longer break if you’ve got the time for a bit more play before finishing for the day. INTRODUCTORY SCENE (OPTIONAL; 30 MIN) If you have the time, you can throw the characters into an initial scene to help the players get a handle on the rules and their characters. This scene can be non-canon or serve as a jump start for the campaign. You can start with something calmer, such as a slice-of-life scene, or immediately throw the characters into a dramatic opening. WRAP-UP AND FEEDBACK (10 MIN) Use the last few minutes of the session to check in with the players—gather their feedback about the session zero, see if they have any additional questions, and ask if they want to revisit any safety tools or content concerns. 172 Chapter 3: Session Zero and Safety Tools"

If you’d like to start with a single-session adventure, the upcoming “Running a One-Shot” section can provide inspiration for your adventure’s setting and story. When you’re ready to dive into a longer campaign, see the “Running a Campaign” section on page 185. THINKING IN BEATS In storytelling, a beat is a moment that changes the trajectory of the narrative—a shift in the world, a significant action or reaction, an emotional revelation, or an important decision. As the GM in a collaborative game, you’re going to take turns with the players, narrating a beat and then letting them react and carry the scene forward with their own beats. It’s like a dance, a conversation, or a game of tennis. This focus on beats is very useful for preparation—rather than writing out every single detail of what’s going to happen, you can think in beats, the moments that give shape to the scene or sequence. The following is an example of thinking in beats to create a countdown. The GM is preparing a session where a mercenary company seizes control of a border town in a narrow mountain pass. The mercenaries are loyal to an invading army and this location will be an important step in their invasion. EXAMPLE BEATS AS A COUNTDOWN TO INVASION 8 The mercenary company makes a partnership with the neighboring kingdom. 7 One of the mercenaries arrives in town and gets a job with the city guard. 6 The undercover mercenary is assigned to night duty, as expected for new hires in the guard. 5 The undercover mercenary ambushes the other night guards and unlocks the town gate. 4 The mercenaries rush through the open gate and attack the guard barracks and the mayor’s house. 3 The mercenaries kill or subdue the city guard and capture the mayor. 2 Under threat of violence to the townspeople, the mayor pledges loyalty to the invading warlord. 1 The warlord’s forces arrive to resupply as the mercenaries hold the town to protect the invaders’ supply lines. 0 The invasion begins. If the PCs are in the town, they can interrupt this sequence of events at any point. They might see the disguised mercenary attacking his fellows, or they might be in the tavern when the mercenaries stream down the main road, headed for the barracks and mayor’s house. Knowing the major beats of the mercenaries’ plan makes it easier to maintain the integrity of the fiction while the PCs are acting. The PCs might stop the attack on the barracks but not the seizure of the mayor. This could lead to the mercenaries fortifying the mayor’s house with him as a hostage while the members of the town guard ask the PCs for assistance. Thinking in beats is also useful for larger-scale planning and off-screen thinking. If the party is racing toward a city to prevent a coup, you can use a progress countdown to track their distance from the city and a standard countdown to represent the steps of that coup. Keep the pace of both countdowns in mind when setting the frequency of events. If the PCs need to travel five hundred miles (represented by the progress countdown), then the coup could take place over a week (represented by the standard countdown), with a countdown step occurring each day. As the PCs make action rolls to determine how far they can travel in a day, you can resolve the advancement of the Progress Countdown, then tick down the standard countdown by 1. Should the PCs need to travel a shorter distance, you can similarly shrink the time frame the coup takes place over, such as from a week to a few days, with each countdown step occurring every few hours. This format lets you know what’s happening as the PCs burst onto the scene, rather than having to improvise in the moment.

Through this lens, we can start to think about enemies and damage as more than collections of mechanics and stat blocks—they’re tools in our GM toolbox for heightening tension and creating drama. As you start GMing Daggerheart, balancing encounters and creating appropriate enemies for your players will often take guesswork during prep. However, the more sessions you run, the easier it will become. Adjust on the fly as necessary to find the right balance as you play, and you’ll naturally figure out what works best for your table. The most important element is to ensure that combat is being used to give players more information about the unfolding story—it reveals more about the world, the plot, or the characters. This section includes general advice for prepping encounters that will, hopefully, make your life easier. These tips are meant to help with creating narratively-grounded encounters and planning how to best challenge your party based on their current capabilities and circumstances. Where it comes to prepping encounters mechanically, chapter 4 has several sections to help, such as “Choosing Adversaries,” “Improvising Adversaries,” and “Using Environments.” Use the following guidelines as a jumping-off place, finetune the details with chapter 4, then tweak combat as needed while you home in on what works best for your group, both narratively and mechanically. BATTLES AND NARRATIVE Battles play an important part in high fantasy adventure stories. Many challenges can be answered through cunning and charm, but battle often serves as the primary vehicle through which obstacles are addressed. Dynamic battles create suspense—forcing players to choose between their various objectives, engaging their character’s motivations and weaknesses, and creating the crucible that the players use to forge their characters into legendary heroes. The following prompts guide you through building the story around the battles, ensuring each clash of swords feels poignant in the greater tale. Narrative Function The first thing to consider when building a battle in Daggerheart is the narrative function the battle is playing. Is this battle an obstacle along the way to a larger objective, designed to show the breadth of a villain’s influence? Is an ambush the result of failed rolls to notice that the party is being tailed? Is this fight the culmination of an arc for a character as they confront a figure from their background? Whatever the answer, that narrative role should stay with you throughout the process of building and running a battle. Adversary Motives The next thing to think about is motive. What are the motives of the adversaries arrayed against the party? What would it take for the adversary to surrender? To flee? What objective does the adversary have beyond survival? If given the choice between capturing the artifact the PCs have with them and delivering the final blow to a character, which way would the adversary act? Keeping these questions in mind can help you make quick decisions about what actions an adversary will take in combat. Dynamic Environment Battles become more memorable when you include compelling adversaries and dynamic environments the players (and the PCs) can interact with in interesting ways. If the enemies are on their own territory, think about how they’d manipulate their environment to stack the deck in their favor. Have they built fortifications on the high ground? Have they blocked off alternate routes to force attackers into a frontal assault with exposed flanks? How can the battlefield and terrain reinforce the narrative goal of the battle and show the adversaries’ motives? Chapter 4 presents environment stat blocks you can use to further bring your battleground to life. FLIGHT AND OTHER FEATURES When building battles, consider the abilities and spells your PCs have. For example, if they can fly, consider adding enemies that can fly or attack distant targets, ensuring the combat remains dynamic and challenging for all PCs. Remember that your players probably chose their features because they want to use them! You have the chance to craft engaging opportunities for the players to show off those powers in exciting ways. 174 Chapter 3: Running a Session"

Setup Early in a campaign, the party is going to travel to a forest known to have especially strong nature spirits protecting it. The party includes Sprout Hilldweller, a Warden of the Elements druid who is being hunted by a corrupted Greater Earth Elemental. The party also has a ranger, Marigold Seok, who would be interested in any disruptions to the natural world and is eager to face the corrupted elemental. The GM, Ben, decides to start the arc with a bang by having the party attacked by Dryads and other nature spirit adversaries as they enter the woods. Narrative Function The fight is meant to communicate to the party that the corrupted earth elemental’s influence has already infected the nature spirits of these woods. It also introduces the enemy types that will play a major role in this arc, helping the characters and players learn their powers and weaknesses. Lastly, it provides an opportunity for the druid and ranger to showcase their Experiences, Sage domain cards, class features, and community features that will provide them with specialized knowledge and relevant abilities for the fight. Adversary Motives Ben decides that the corrupted Earth Elemental wants to sever all connections between mortals and nature so that nature can return to a primordial state of unchecked growth. The elemental corrupted the dryads and other forest spirits have been warped by capitalizing on their resentment of outsiders and stoking their fears about the forest being destroyed. Now the elemental can possess them at will without their knowledge or memory. The fight will take place in a former druid grove using the Abandoned Grove environment, the site of a bloody confrontation where the possessed dryads and other nature spirits killed most of the druids and drove out the others. Complicating the situation is the fact that the dryads don’t remember being possessed, only a violent conflict with the druids over a poorly remembered disagreement. Any substantial conversation with the dryads in the grove exposes that foggy memory and provides a thread to pull on. Ben plans to have the elemental assume direct control and attack the party after just a couple of beats of interaction, using a hidden countdown. When the fight starts, Ben plans to hint at the manipulation by describing the dryads and treants moving as if they were being controlled, with the Dryads weeping as they pull down trees to attack the party. This complicates the apparent motives of the adversaries and should prime the PCs to look beyond first appearances to find out what’s going on. Dynamic Environment Ben plans to let the PCs arrive alone in the Abandoned Grove so he can use the environment’s “Overgrown Battlefield” feature to encourage them to investigate and begin piecing together clues. After that, the dryad and their forces can arrive to confront the PCs. The PCs will likely explain themselves, exposing the weirdness around the dryads’ memories. Ben also makes a note to describe some oddities about the woods and dryads, signaling to the PCs that something is wrong. Next, Ben draws inspiration from the Burning Heart of the Wood environment (see the “Environment Stat Blocks” section on page 242). He utilizes its “Grasping Vines” and “Chaos Magic Locus” features and adapts them to Tier 2. This can make the scene more perilous and memorable—the vines can Restrain the PCs to escalate the stakes in a social or combat scene, and the “Chaos Magic Locus” feature further signals to the PCs that something is magically wrong with these woods. Alternatively, Ben could decide to skip the “Chaos Magic Locus” feature and develop another passive feature of his own. Maybe a certain species of animal is following the party and can be befriended for more information, or a pack of dangerous creatures will find them if they rest for too long before reaching the grove. 175 Chapter 3: Running a Session"

The location of a bandit’s hideout, the magical ritual needed to break a curse, or the weakness of a powerful monster— this steady stream of information helps the players decide where to go and what to do. Information keeps the story moving by answering questions, introducing new questions, or complicating the party’s understanding of something they thought they knew. On a slightly longer time frame—every few sessions, at the end of an arc, or at special moments when it makes sense in the fiction—loot can be an exciting reward. For example, PCs might find gear in a mercenary company’s supply wagon after a few sessions of searching for missing mercenaries. Characters should get access to weapons and armor of their tier, usually within the first few levels of entering a new tier to keep pace with adversaries. Some players love getting new weapons and armor, while others may have established an emotional connection to an item (for example, a family heirloom sword or armor once worn by an old friend) and want to keep it. If PCs want to keep their current weapon or armor, consider other ways they could be enhanced. A clever witch could impart enchantments on a breastplate to make it more durable, a blacksmith could upgrade arrow tips to deal more damage, or a god could bless a sword with a deadly edge. You can employ a variety of narrative beats to improve or refurbish the PCs’ equipment, upgrading it to the appropriate tier. CRAFTING SCENES One of your main responsibilities as a GM in Daggerheart is to set the scene for your players. Whenever you start a session, arrive at a new place, or change the situation, the players are going to look to you for what they need to know. When you do this, think with all of your senses—not just what this place looks like, but what does it smell, feel, taste, and sound like? What is something unique or unexpected about this place, and what does that say about it? Your players will use these details to interact with the world, so give them enough to not only picture the scene, but make choices about what they do and where they go. Example: “You step into the mouth of the cave and for a long moment you’re in pitch darkness. You can hear the soft tap, tap, tap of water in the distance suggesting there may be an underground river ahead. The stone is slick beneath your feet, as you gingerly step forward. At first, there’s only the dank smell you expect from a cave: the earthy tang of lichen on mold. But then there’s a gust of wind forced from deep within the cavern, and you’re overcome by the sickly sweet smell of rotting meat. Something died here recently… As you move deeper inside, you begin to make out sharp white stalactites bearing down on you…. No—these aren’t formations of stone. They’re teeth! You aren’t standing on slick stone; you’re balanced on the salivating tongue of a great beast. You feel that fetid wash of air come over you again—the creature is taking a deep breath and preparing to swallow. What do you want to do?” SHARING THE SPOTLIGHT It’s rare that every PC will organically have the same amount of spotlight time during a given session. In any group, some players are more outgoing than others—and some PCs are instigators, while others are more cautious. As the GM, you can help ensure that the story’s focus rotates between the PCs, so each player has ample time in the spotlight. TIE TOGETHER STORY ELEMENTS If you know that a specific PC is going to be in the spotlight for a session or an arc, you can try to involve the other PC by drawing on their ties to the spotlit PC and by including story elements that will excite them. For example, if the courtier bard is invited to a debutante ball that ties into his backstory, you might decide that the ball will also be hosting a fencing tournament (which you hope will excite the swashbuckler rogue) and social dancing (which should interest the noble- born sorcerer). You’re confident that the warrior will be excited about the scene already, as he has sworn to protect the bard and is not-so-secretly in love with him. ENGAGE QUIET PLAYERS You can also engage a quieter player by directly inviting action from their character, rather than broadly asking the whole party what they’re doing next. Alternatively, you could ask how their character feels about unfolding events. USE VISUAL AIDS Another approach to balancing play is to use visual aids. For example, you can draw out a space for each character on a sheet of paper to make an action tracker. When a player takes an action, they place one token on the tracker in their character’s space. Throughout a session, a quick look at the tracker will show you which players are taking more actions and help you remember to engage the players that haven’t acted as much. This visual reminder can also help the other players know who could use an invitation into the spotlight. ENCOURAGE UNGUIDED PLAY Sometimes you might realize your NPCs and the wider scene have received a lot of focus. As the GM, you too can share the spotlight by creating opportunities to let the players or their characters speak among themselves. The players can carry out a downtime scene or interpersonal moment without your input while you listen and observe—and take note of story threads to weave into later scenes. 176 Chapter 3: Running a Session"

Conflict in Daggerheart results when the characters’ hopes and actions are met by opposition and uncertainty. If the group’s wizard seeks to become the world’s greatest spellcaster, her quest likely won’t be as satisfying if she’s never challenged along the way. Conflicts can be external (outside forces act against a character) or internal (a character struggles against themself emotionally or intellectually). Our wizard might face external conflict: tests of skill against other mages, magical puzzles that appraise her knowledge and cunning, and eventually trials against legendary beings who wield the most potent magic in the world. Meanwhile, her internal conflicts might include struggling with the ideologies taught to her in school, or even fearing the destructive power of her own magic. The strongest character arcs in Daggerheart emerge from a combination of internal and external conflicts. External conflicts can bring up unresolved tensions from internal conflicts, while resolving internal conflicts can provide clarity for a character that allows them to overcome external conflict. When designing conflicts for maximum emotional impact, challenge characters in a way that ties in their internal struggles. If a character struggles with self-confidence, challenge them to excel. If a character struggles with the ethics of using power, put them in situations where using their power has high stakes for other people, not just themselves. Conflicts like these push the characters to better themselves, forging them decision by decision until they emerge as unforgettable heroes. 177 Chapter 3: Running a Session"

Always keep motive in mind, considering how the characters’ request or demand aligns or conflicts with the NPCs’ aims. When NPCs or creatures aren’t hostile but aren’t inclined to do as the party asks, it helps to think about the scene less as a conflict and more as a collaborative process where both parties are trying to get what they want while maintaining or improving their existing relationship. Influencing NPCs For everyday social obstacles, a single successful action may be sufficient to progress, such as haggling down a merchant or convincing a steward to let you into a noble’s estate. On a success with Fear, you can introduce a minor setback—for example, an NPC might demand a bribe or set other special terms before they’ll do what the character asks. When dealing with more formidable NPCs, a single action might not be enough to change their mind. A hostile countess couldn’t be convinced to send troops to help fight a necromancer with a single roll. Since an adversary or PC becomes Vulnerable while their Stress slots are full, you can use an adversary’s Stress slots as the meter for tracking an extended or higher-stakes social conflict. By default, one successful social action against an adversary (intimidation, deceit, bribery, etc.) forces them to mark a Stress. Some abilities (such as class or domain abilities) also force adversaries to mark Stress—these are highly useful in social conflicts so long as they’re narratively applicable. (Using an ability that forces an adversary to mark Stress upon a successful attack may be ill-advised in a noble’s court). Example: A Petty Noble has a distaste for the party. The Petty Noble has 4 Stress, so if the PCs want to get back into the noble’s good graces or force them to concede a point, the GM could tell the party that if they fill the noble’s Stress track, they’ll change the noble’s mind. Countdowns in Social Conflict If a social situation has especially high stakes, you might set a consequence countdown or a time limit to represent the adversary’s patience. The PCs take actions to mark the adversary’s Stress, while trying to minimize consequences that tick down the countdown. If this high-stakes countdown triggers, the PCs lose the opportunity—or suffer a consequence, such as being kicked from a gala or having the guards called on them. EXAMPLE SOCIAL CONFLICT The party is making an appeal to a Petty Noble to send troops to deal with a growing undead threat in the woods. The noble is disinclined to help, even if they did believe that the undead threat was real. Ben tells the party that the noble has 5 Stress, and if they can force the noble to mark the whole track, they’ll convince the noble to dispatch troops to investigate. The party’s wizard Barnabas goes first, producing the still-twitching tibia taken from a skeleton in the swamp. He describes the magical power needed to maintain a necromantic effect when a corpse is rendered into such small pieces. Ben calls that a Presence Roll, but Asa asks to roll for Barnabas with Knowledge, focusing on the arcane display and demonstration of intellect. Ben says that he would normally give disadvantage on a Knowledge Roll here, since Presence is usually better for persuasion, but that the evidence would give advantage on that roll. With advantage and disadvantage canceling out, Barnabas rolls a success with Hope, and Ben marks a Stress on the noble. Since Barnabas rolled a success with Hope, Ben invites the players to continue. Next, Jasper the bard takes the stage, recalling the story of when the party entered the swamp and first battled the undead raised by this necromantic force. Jasper uses their Enrapture spell and makes a Presence Roll, getting a success with Fear. Jasper’s player, Emerson, chooses to mark Stress to force the noble to mark a Stress, bringing them down to 2 Stress remaining. Ben gains a Fear and makes a move, describing how they can hear a carriage arriving outside, and it won’t be long until they aren’t alone anymore. Since Jasper has the Petty Noble Enraptured, Ben asks Emerson whether they want to continue. Emerson says they’ll weave the words of any party member that speaks into the spell if that’s okay. Ben agrees, wanting to involve the whole party. Next, the group’s ranger Marigold takes the economic angle, telling the noble that if they don’t act, the noble’s subjects will die and therefore be unable to work and pay taxes. Kate makes a Presence Roll for Marigold and critically succeeds! Since a normal social action would mark a Stress, Ben decides that he’ll mark 2 Stress instead on a critical success, which includes the noble’s last Stress. With the Petty Noble’s Stress exhausted, Ben describes how they finally agree to dispatch a patrol. 178 Chapter 3: Running a Session"

Violence conveys underlying emotions, developing NPCs and the wider world they inhabit. When bandits raid a village, they’re not just looking to hurt others—their motive might be greed or desperation, but either way, violence is their means to an end. The following sections give guidance for creating emotionally resonant combat scenes. Layering Goals into Combat The drama of a battle should stem from narrative goals, rather than solely from the risk the PCs will die. Daggerheart isn’t a particularly deadly game, and the players likely know that. The PCs typically fight for a reason, such as defending loved ones or subverting a villain’s schemes—if their battle relates to multiple goals or narrative threads, this adds uncertainty to the outcomes and increases dramatic tension. You can do this by ensuring that the adversary’s motivation is front and center and introducing an objective that goes beyond “kill or knock out the opponents.” If you establish a special objective for the adversaries (or PCs) before the conflict begins, the scene suddenly has more dimensions and characters have immediate options for actions to take beyond just trading attacks. Another way of thinking about action scenes is to consider the defining action verb. Is this scene just about fighting the enemy or is the party securing a position so that the wizard can conduct the ritual by the solstice? The follow example illustrates a combat with three objectives: Example: After the blood mage Caressa kidnapped the governor’s husband Osten, the PCs tracked her across the Shattered Mountains. When they confront her in the Ruins of Nix, she’s conducting a ritual to seize Osten’s latent magical power. The PCs want to stop the ritual, save Osten, and capture Caressa. But which of those goals is most important? If the PCs are winning the fight, what happens if you put Osten in danger and make the players choose between rescuing him and capturing Caressa? The outcome of the previous example is uncertain, entirely dependent on the PCs’ choices and luck. They could achieve a partial victory by capturing Caressa after Osten dies or allowing Caressa to get away to save Osten. With cleverness and good rolls, they could stop Caressa, capture her, and save Osten, accomplishing all their goals. The uncertainty is what makes the combat dynamic and tense. When in doubt, you can use the following table to randomly generate an objective to work into a combat or action scene. Roll 1d12 or pick an option to use as the goal of the adversaries (or the PCs). Objective Generation Prompt 1d12 Objective 1 Acquire (obtain or steal) an important item or items. 2 Capture one or more of the opponents. 3 Activate a magical device. 4 Frame a character or tarnish their reputation. 5 Drive the opponent into a corner or ambush point. 6 Stop a magical ritual, legal ceremony, or time- sensitive spell. 7 Hold the line—keep the enemy from reaching a specific area or group. 8 Plant evidence or a tracking device on a target. 9 Secure a specific location ahead of another group’s arrival. 10 Harass the opponent to deplete their resources or keep them occupied. 11 Destroy a piece of architecture, a statue, a shrine, or a weapon. 12 Investigate a situation to confirm or deny existing information. Using Fear for Drama During battles, spend Fear to keep the characters on their toes. Duality Rolls cause momentum to dramatically ebb and flow as the PCs fail their rolls or succeed with Fear in the fight. While a lucky streak of Hope Rolls means you don’t automatically get a GM move, you can still interrupt the players’ momentum by spending a Fear to make a GM move. Because of this, we recommend keeping a few Fear on reserve, especially during battles, so you have the ability to interrupt the scene and create more tension as needed. When spending Fear, think about what move will most powerfully impact the scene. Change the energy or nature of the fight by activating a powerful foe’s ability, bringing reinforcements into the battle, shifting the environment, or having the foes move boldly toward their objective. 179 Chapter 3: Running a Session"

These phases of battle create a sense of natural evolution and escalation, increasing the dramatic tension. Consider the following ways to introduce phases to a combat: Change the Terms of Engagement Turn a fight into a chase, reveal information that turns the group’s allies against them, or give the party reason to temporarily ally with a faction they’re battling. Example: During a pitched battle with an infamous thief, you use a GM move to have the thief steal an important artifact from the PCs and attempt to flee. This results in a chase, keeping the story dynamic and forcing the players to adapt. Change the Battlefield During a battle, use a natural phenomenon, an arcane effect, or an adversary’s action to alter the environment. This change can be mechanical, such as a raging blizzard reducing visibility, or aesthetic, such as a powerful wizard dominating the sky with arcane runes while channeling a powerful spell. Some battlefield changes repeat themselves—for example, an earth dragon might occasionally crash into the walls of their lair, dropping boulders and changing the shape of the battlefield. This move might occur on a countdown loop. Other changes only happen once, in which case you might create an Environment move triggered by a specific narrative or mechanical event. A god’s champion might sunder the coliseum in a divine realm when she marks her last point of Stress, shattering the floor and dropping the party atop a pane of otherworldly glass surrounded by the rich colors of the cosmos. If you plan this type of move ahead of time, you might prepare two maps: one for the start of the fight, and another for when the space changes. Change the Foes Video games often change their bosses at a certain point in a fight, such as when their health is halved or they’re seemingly defeated. Taking a cue from those battles, you can change an adversary in behavior, form, or both: A massive, lumbering enemy splits into multiple, more agile adversaries who act in perfect synchronicity. A defeated foe courses with eldritch power that remolds their flesh into an unspeakable form and grants them sinister new powers. In Daggerheart, you can create a phase change for an enemy in a few ways. You might give the foe a passive feature that triggers when half of their Hit Points are marked, or you might prepare two adversary stat blocks, one for each phase. This book presents several adversaries with the “Phase Change” feature, which you can use as inspiration for creating your own. If you didn’t prepare a phase change but the party is defeating a major foe more easily than expected, it’s okay to let the PCs have the easy win. However, if that feels anticlimactic, feel free to improvise a phase two. Describe how the adversary seems to be defeated, then narrate them standing back up or surging with new energy, clear some of their HP, change some of their statistics or base attack, and improvise a new feature or two to represent how they’ve changed. An enemy that throws off their armor might lower their damage thresholds but gain Relentless and move about with blistering speed. You might even switch to a different stat block on the fly as the foe transforms into a new and unexpected form. When an enemy takes a new form, try to draw upon the story to explain the second phase. A blood mage holding out a bloody hand and channeling a powerful spell to transform into an Abomination is both surprising and inevitable. But if the players never learned that the enemy was a blood mage, that reveal won’t be as satisfying. Foreshadow information about enemies in advance as much as you can, but if you have to create connective tissue in the moment, you can treat it as a reveal as the transforming enemy boasts about not having demonstrated their full power. 180 Chapter 3: Running a Session"

You can use downtime scenes as a pressure release valve to vary the intensity of the story and give the PCs room to breathe. Empower your players to frame their own downtime scenes. Ask the players what it looks like as they tend to their wounds or unwind together, encouraging them to take the reins and work with other players whose characters are involved. PROJECTS DURING DOWNTIME The Work on a Project downtime move requires more GM input than other downtime moves and is best suited for long- term endeavors the PCs wish to undertake. These projects are typically tracked using a Progress Countdown. When deciding the starting value of the countdown, consider the complexity of the project, the availability of relevant tools, and the impact of the project on the story. If completing the project will give the group essential information they need to move on, you may want to set the starting value at a low number to ensure the group doesn’t have to wait too long for the next clue or story beat. If the project isn’t tightly linked to other parts of the story and it simply requires time, you might start the countdown at a higher number. Simple projects might tick down the countdown each time the player uses the Work on a Project move. However, if the project is skill dependent, you can ask how the PC makes progress and then call for a roll using a trait that matches their approach. When a player rolls to progress their project, it doesn’t feel great if the roll simply ends in failure. If you use the Dynamic Countdown Advancement table in the earlier “Countdowns” section, consider letting a failure give the PC special insight into their goal, which grants them advantage on their next roll for that project. Alternatively, you can instead use the following criteria so the PC always makes progress even on a failure: • Critical Success: 4 ticks • Success with Hope: 3 ticks • Success with Fear: 2 ticks • Any failure: 1 tick GM DOWNTIME When players use downtime to rest and refresh, you gain Fear and can progress a countdown happening in the background: • On a short rest, gain 1d4 Fear. • On a long rest, gain an amount of Fear equal to the number of PCs + 1d4 and advance a long-term countdown. This helps make the world feel alive—and it reminds players that the more resting they do, the more the world moves without them, so they might want to be careful how much they rest. EXTENDED DOWNTIME If you’re fast-forwarding the story across multiple days (or longer), you probably don’t need a separate scene for each long rest during that time. During these longer stretches, consider talking to your players about what their characters want to accomplish, then using montages to illustrate the passage of time. You gain 1d6 Fear per PC and can advance the long-term countdowns as appropriate for the extended period of rest. Some PC goals might require a single roll (or none at all). Others might call for a series of progress countdown rolls to advance a project across several long rests. It’s trivial for a bard to gather rumors during a week-long stay in the city, but you might ask them to make a Presence Roll to see whether they learn some especially important information in the process. Similarly, you could ask your warrior to make a Finesse Roll if they’re trying to enhance their armor with rare materials obtained in their last adventure. 181 Chapter 3: Running a Session"

In a game focused on character relationships, personal story arcs, and heroic adventure, the death of a PC should not happen casually. As the GM, you’re charged with honestly portraying the world, and death is more permanent in Daggerheart than in other games of the same genre. Use the following principles to help you navigate these moments fairly and empathetically. Tip: Adversaries follow different rules for death than PCs; see “Defeated Adversaries” on page 208 for details. CHOOSING A DEATH MOVE When a PC marks their last Hit Point, they must make a death move. Two of the three moves give the player full control over whether their PC lives or dies: with Blaze of Glory, the player is accepting the PC’s death, and with Avoid Death, the player is defying the PC’s death. Risk It All comes down to a dice roll— the PC has a nearly even chance of living or dying. When a player is considering which death move to choose, make space for them to work and talk through their decision. You might give them a moment to think by shifting focus to another PC, or keep focus on the dying PC to let the player take the reins of the story. Character death is not always satisfying in the moment, especially if the character’s cause of death isn’t directly tied to their personal story. But in a heroic fantasy adventure, death is always a possibility for characters trying to change the world. Death moves give a fatally injured PC a chance for a memorable moment, whether it’s going out in a Blaze of Glory or Risking It All on a roll of the dice. Avoid Death If a player is certain they aren’t ready to say goodbye to their PC, this death move ensures the PC’s survival—though they have a chance of taking a scar and permanently crossing out one of their Hope slots. If the character only has one Hope slot remaining when they make this move and they gain a scar, the player must retire the character. Even so, that ending may be preferable for players who would rather see their character give up the adventuring life than die. Using this move, the PC stays unconscious until healed by an ally or until the party’s next long rest. Try to give the player chances to participate in play if the party isn’t able to heal their PC or finish a long rest in short order. You might invite them to temporarily control an NPC in the meantime or, for something more character focused, narrate a scene of their PC on the knife’s edge between life and death. On this precipice, they could be visited by the spirit of a departed loved one, receive a vision of a disaster they need to avert, or encounter something else that keeps them involved in the story. Even without gaining a scar, this move still comes with a cost: the current situation worsens, no matter the PC’s fate. Work with the player to determine how that manifests. The situation might escalate as a new wave of enemies approaches or a countdown ticks down. Alternatively, the PC’s fall might be what turns the tide of battle in the enemy’s favor—they might seize an important item from the heroes or draw power from the character’s suffering. Risk It All This is the move that the GM has the least say in. The Duality Dice decide the character’s fate, and with the exception of the 10th-level Resurrection spell (which can only be used once), that roll is final unless you provide another means of resurrection in your story. If the player rolls with Hope, help them decide how to divide the value of the Hope Die between Hit Points and Stress to clear. You might remind the player that if they choose to clear only a small number of Hit Points, they may be forced to make another death move after just one further blow. Though it is important to reward your player if they roll with Hope by spotlighting this moment when their PC defies death, it is just as important to reward your player if they roll with Fear and their character meets their end. Let them have some final words with a friend or a memory that plays as they fade from consciousness. This gives them a moment to say goodbye to their character in a way that feels important and satisfying. Blaze of Glory If the player decides that their character will go out in a Blaze of Glory, work with them to ensure that the one action they take is as meaningful as possible without breaking the integrity of the story. When the seraph goes out in a Blaze of Glory, you might rule that their final attack is fatal, even if the adversary had more HP left than a critical success could possibly deal. But it might be a bad idea to let that same seraph shatter the barrier between the Mortal Realm and the Hallows Above to allow their god to walk freely among mortals. Consider the group’s agreements about tone established in your session zero when deciding the scale of action the Blaze of Glory can accomplish. 182 Chapter 3: Running a Session"

When multiple PCs are making death moves and there’s a real risk that everyone will die, it’s important to check in with the players as the scene unfolds. How do they feel about the scene and the chance that the whole party will be left dead or incapacitated? Is this a good place for the campaign’s story to potentially end? Should the PCs cut their losses and flee? Since PCs that choose Avoid Death are helpless without assistance, the party is left at the mercy of their adversaries or fate (the GM) if every PC takes that option. It’s also useful to consider the motivation of the adversaries present. Do the adversaries want to kill the PCs, or do they just want the party out of the way so they can pursue their motives? Would they be more likely to leave the PCs for dead, take them prisoner to gloat, or capture them to extract information? If your players aren’t interested in a heroic tragedy at the moment, work with them to decide what makes sense in the scene. Death is a real threat in Daggerheart, but the game is always a collaboration. If the party is going to meet their end, it should be because everyone at the table wants to tell that story. If the players don’t want the party to die here but it’s difficult to come up with a way they survive, look to their background questions and their relationships with factions and prominent NPCs. Are they taken captive by the enemy? Does an old ally show up with reinforcements to drive off the enemies? Does an agent of the seraph’s god or a nature spirit friendly to the druid whisk the PCs away to safety? Does an associate of the Syndicate rogue provide cover for the PCs to withdraw? If the group decides that their party’s story is done but they want to continue the overall campaign, hold a mid-campaign session zero to make new characters and figure out how to connect this new party to the existing story in a way that everyone is excited about. The following section provides additional guidance for introducing new characters, whether one or two new PCs join the party or a new party picks up where the previous one left off. INTRODUCING A NEW CHARACTER If a PC dies or retires from adventuring, you should collaborate with the player between sessions to develop a new character for them to play at the current level of the party. If your player and group want to, they can answer the usual connection questions, giving them existing relationships to everyone in the party. You can also advance the party’s story by taking a more dramatic route—skip the normal connection questions and instead ask one or more of the following questions: • You have vital information the party needs to continue on their journey. What is it, and how did you obtain it? • You are in desperate need of help that only the party can provide. What danger follows you, and what do you have for the party in exchange? • You know somebody in the party very well and have searched them out. What happened the last time you saw this person, and why are you seeking them out now? • You lost your last adventuring party to something or someone terrible. What caused their downfall, and how is this new party connected to those previous adventurers? • You are part of a faction that opposed the party, but now you want to align with them. What happened that made you seek them out, and how are you going to prove to the party that you can be trusted? • You have been charged with delivering a lost item to a member of the party. What is it, and what personal quest is it tied to that requires working with the party? LEVELING YOUR PARTY You can level up your party any time you wish, though it’s often simplest to do so at the end of an important session— such as when your party reaches the end of a story arc (see the “Planning a Story Arc” section on page 189). All players should level up at the same time, following the “Level Up” section on their character guide. Ask them to reflect on what their character learned in the previous arc and how it might have changed who they are, then choose two options from the list in their Level Up guide. If you are running a short campaign, you may want to level up every other session (or whatever cadence feels appropriate for your campaign length). This accelerates the power growth of your PCs, but it also allows them to experience the full arc of their characters’ mechanics before the campaign ends. When your PCs level up, they’ll gain new abilities, spells, damage thresholds, Experiences, and more, so be sure to review what changed for them. This is a good time to plan opportunities for your players to use those new features over the next arc. For example, if a PC’s new ability helps them eavesdrop on conversations, you could begin the next session with an espionage mission where that skill comes in handy. Similarly, if a PC chooses the Animal Whisperer Experience, they’d likely enjoy encountering wild animals that could be tamed during the upcoming arc. 183 Chapter 3: Running a Session"

First, read the prologue aloud, and when you reach a blank, have a player fill in the answer using one of the available options. Move around the table, having players make decisions until all of the blanks are filled. Then read the completed prologue to the table. Feel free to ask additional questions, clarify ideas, and expand upon the information until you all feel comfortable moving forward. PROLOGUE Our story takes place within the Kingdom of (1) .

Maybe the wild and dangerous creature they find is the monster a player referenced in their PC’s backstory, perhaps the mysterious land they travel through is a PC’s childhood home, or perhaps the NPC looking for the target is a character one of the PCs has history with. The more you incorporate the PCs’ backstories into the present adventure, the more you empower the members of your table to continue making bold choices. When players have agency in story construction, it lessens the responsibility of GMing and welcomes everyone into a shared adventure.

What’s next? Most tables will start a campaign: a series of connected sessions often played weekly or monthly that let everyone explore their character’s story over an extended period of time. When you decide to start a campaign together, you can kickstart your adventure using the guidance in this section, along with the inspiration presented in chapter 5. In Daggerheart, campaigns are intended to be personal, focused, and responsive. The amount you plan before character creation depends on you and your players’ preferences, but the details players provide about their characters should be the primary scaffolding upon which you’ll craft the majority of the campaign. Aside from overarching plot beats, you’ll often be prepping just the material you need week after week, letting the story evolve naturally through play. Chapter 5—“Campaign Frames”—provides six scafoldings for different campaigns. If you’re an experienced GM, you may have your own method of campaign prep—as always, feel free to utilize the pieces from this book that help and ignore the pieces that don’t. CHOOSING A CAMPAIGN FRAME Before your session zero, you might choose to implement a campaign frame to ground the players in the type of fantasy story you’re interested in as a GM. The fantasy genre is so wide—providing a campaign frame can give players a strong jumping-off place to start brainstorming their characters. Daggerheart provides several campaign frames to start you off, but these shouldn’t limit the stories you tell with this system. If you have a strong idea about the kind of campaign you want to run for your table, use the structure of the frames to build your own before your session zero. You can find the following campaign frames in chapter 5: The Witherwild When an invading nation attacks an ancient forest deity, a virulent overgrowth spreads throughout the land. Five Banners Burning Long-brewing tensions between rival nations boil over, threatening all-out war. Beast Feast When a small village’s monster defense system fails, the local heroes must venture into the endless caverns below to fix it—and cook up trouble for the creatures that stand in their way! The Age of Umbra In a dying world immersed in relentless shadow and nightmarish monsters, small communities hold fast to the light, hoping those who endure can find a way to save this broken realm before all is lost to darkness. Motherboard In a world where magic takes the form of the technology left behind by a long-fallen civilization, a new threat rises as a malicious virus spreads through the machines that wander the Wastes.

If you’re utilizing a campaign frame, use the map detailed in that section. Digital copies of these maps are available on the Daggerheart website for download. If you know at character creation that you’ll be running a campaign, you can bring a blank map to your session zero to fill out together. Otherwise, you can always introduce it at the top of your next session to integrate into your game moving forward. To start, place the map on the table and explain to the players that you’ll be using it to build the region together. Choose the name of the region from the options available (or make up your own) and write that name on the sheet. If you’re using a campaign frame, the name of the region is provided for you. Next, remind the players about any locations they have already created for the setting. Pass the map around and have them label the locations they created anywhere they’d like. Then, choose one of the locations from the list on the sheet and add it to the map. Describe this place for the rest of the table—what is it? Why is it called this? What makes it so significant? Then pass the map to another player to do the same. Encourage them to tie in their character’s backstory or history with the new location if they wish. As players describe the locations they’ve chosen, record any important information about them in your notes. The map should continue around the table like this until it feels like it is populated with enough exciting locations and plot hooks for you to work with. With four players, twice around the table is usually enough. Remember, you can always do this again at the start of another session to fill out the map further, or even introduce a new region that connects to the current one. After the table feels happy with the details they’ve added, take the map back and begin the adventure. Maybe it’s somewhere the players have already added, or maybe it’s a new place— either way, this will help you orient yourself for the campaign moving forward. FILLING SPACE, LEAVING BLANKS As part of the prep for your next session, you’ll want to review the map your table built together. Think about how the locations your players created might affect the region, and add anything you think might be important or relevant to the sheet. For example, if someone labeled a spot with “The Healing Fields,” you might consider adding a town nearby that specializes in creating Health Potions or curing ailments, or a mage’s tower that overlooks the fields to protect them. Pay attention to where the PCs currently are in their journey— where might they consider going next? It’s also important to leave blanks. Don’t feel the need to fill everything in, and don’t worry about planning out what every labeled landmark or town is like. Leaving some things vague gives you the freedom to adapt on the fly and reduces the amount of worldbuilding work you have to do for places your players might never visit. 186 Chapter 3: Running a Campaign"

The most important details to utilize while building a campaign are the answers to a character’s Background Questions. The Background Questions are designed to generate story hooks the players care about, which you can leverage for narrative fodder during the campaign. Take good notes during character creation and ask follow-up questions. Don’t be afraid to dig deeper into anything the players offer up during this process. If they make up a person, ask them for their name. If they invent a place, ask them what it’s called and what it’s like. Ensure you record at least one or two things about the world that are important to each player and their character. The more you incorporate these things into the campaign, the more invested that player tends to become. BACKSTORY NOTES After character creation, create a simple list of important narrative elements the players have given you, sorted by character. For example, you might make the following notes about the PCs: Marigold Seok (She/Her)—Seaborne Elf Ranger Played by Kate (she/her) Born in the floating city of Bloomfare. Had to leave her mother behind to go on the run. She is being chased down by the leaders of the Four Elementals for stealing their stone of power during the last ceremony. Barnabas Britespite (He/Him)—Loreborne Simiah Wizard Played by Asa (he/him) Obsessed with finding relics, treasures, and bones of legendary creatures. He thinks these should be collected and utilized for various practical purposes, not stashed away into museums. Wants to gather as much knowledge as he can in his lifetime. Uses bone runes to cast magic. Served as the advisor to King Guthril, but failed to protect the king’s daughter Nira from being killed by wild beasts during her first hunt with him. Left the kingdom in shame. Is chasing down the fang of the great dragon Krugthar, because it is said to contain knowledge of every creature the dragon has ever consumed. Is rivals with Maverick, a snobby human treasure hunter who is trying to collect all the bones of legendary creatures to put them in a museum. Jasper Flores (They/Them)—Highborne Halfling Bard Played by Emerson (they/them) Grew up in The Sunbearer’s Crescent with the royal Galamore family of halflings. Was in a secret relationship with the princess, Astrid Galamore. They had a secret place they would meet. Astrid and Jasper were supposed to run away together, but she never showed up. Jasper still wonders what happened. There are rumors that she was forced to marry someone else. Was trained by Mage Yaro within Illiat’s Tower. Yaro is the one who convinced them to travel the world and learn all they can. They look up to a fellow bard named Quill who plays at the Golden Goose in The Sunbearer’s Crescent. Jasper met Quill through Yaro. Sprout Hilldweller (She/Her)—Wanderborne Fungril Druid Played by Chen (she/her) Was chased out of the city of Branishar because she accidentally spent too much time there and decimated the environment around her. She’s learned she has to keep moving: she can’t stay in one place for too long or bad things happen. She uses her Death Connection ability to absorb and memorialize the core memories of all people she’s slain. She sometimes forgets those histories aren’t her own. 187 Chapter 3: Running a Campaign"

Maybe Maverick, the snobby human treasure collector that Barnabas is rivals with, could be the same person that Astrid Galamore, the halfling princess, was forced to marry? And if that’s the case, what if Maverick was now forcing Mage Yaro to use his magic to invade the fungril network and seize more great treasures around the world without having to leave the kingdom? This would create a crossover between Jasper, Sprout, and Barnabas, so it seems like a good place to start our campaign. But let’s keep thinking. This type of conflict would likely eventually lead them to return to the Galamore kingdom to stop Maverick. This journey could be hindered by the fungril forces Mage Yaro is controlling, giving Sprout an opportunity to interact with the corrupted network and get hints of what is to come in a way nobody else would be able to. And when they all finally arrive in the Galamore kingdom, there could be a twist! Maybe Astrid convinced Quill, her and Jasper’s bard friend, to use shapeshifting magic to take her place right under Maverick’s nose so she could leave the kingdom and search for Jasper? This could be a fun opportunity to flip the “princess in peril” trope on its head and provide an unexpected reveal once they reach the kingdom. If this is the case, we’ll also want to brainstorm a clue Astrid could leave behind at the secret place where she and Jasper used to meet so the party can go after her. But that’s down the road, no need to flesh that out immediately. Marigold needs some love—maybe we could put the floating city of Bloomfare in the great dragon Krugthar’s path of destruction? This would push Marigold to return home and face the consequences of her actions to save her mother’s life, while giving Barnabas an opportunity to chase down the dragon he wants so badly. But given they’ll have to face a dragon, this should probably be later in the campaign. So perhaps in the interim, to keep Marigold’s backstory involved, we could put some elemental creatures on the party’s trail intermittently as they travel. This will keep the threat of her home and the reminder of what she did relevant until she must return to confront them. Maybe we even make that our first encounter of the campaign to set up that long-running danger and tie Marigold in at the start. A few extra threads to tie up—Sprout should probably have to deal with what she did in Branishar. Either she faces signs of the same thing happening wherever she travels, or something pushes her to return home. Barnabas should probably discover something unexpected about Nira’s death—could she still be alive? If so, maybe she finds him to reveal that her father King Guthril secretly set up an ambush to have her killed. It wasn’t Barnabas’s fault, and Nira wants revenge. That’s more than enough for now! As the campaign plays out, there will be plenty more to work with and some of these plans may change drastically—but this is a great foundation to work from. 188 Chapter 3: Running a Campaign"

Arcs are a connected series of sessions within a campaign that focus on a specific objective, theme, character, or idea. Though you won’t know for sure the path your players will take, by preparing the structure of the arc, you can ensure that you’re giving them the adequate narrative fodder for a satisfying story. Arcs are typically between three to five sessions in length, though they can be longer depending on how large of a campaign you’re running. It’s usually good to start small and build up to larger arcs as players get more invested in the story you’re telling together, but an arc’s structure typically remains the same regardless of the length. There are a few different structures that stories often take, but we’re going to use the Three-Act Structure as our framework because it is the most common and is the easiest to identify in many of today’s movies and TV shows. As always, feel free to experiment with your own style of storytelling and only use the things from this section that help you at your table! The Three-Act Structure is pretty straightforward—Act One is the introduction, Act Two is the trials and tribulations, and Act Three is the finale. This is something we see in almost every popular movie or TV show—a character wants something, they work hard and face challenges to get that thing, and finally succeed or fail. Either way, they always change because of the journey they went through. Because of this, it’s often what players expect out of a good story, even if they don’t know it. It’s what feels satisfying to us, because it’s the way we’re used to seeing stories. We can utilize that expectation in our prep to make our work easier. Let’s take the example from the previous “Tying Backstories Together” section to form our first arc. Given how much the NPC Maverick is intertwined in multiple PCs’ backstories, he’s going to be our focus here, since that will give almost everyone a chance to have their backstories interwoven into the story at the start. Maverick is the snobby human treasure collector who is Barnabas’s rival, and we’ve made the decision that Maverick is the one who stole Astrid Galamore’s hand in marriage, even though she has been in love with our party’s bard Jasper since childhood. Because Maverick is now residing in the kingdom with her, we’ve also decided that he is forcing Jasper’s old mentor, Mage Yaro, to use his arcane powers to tap into the expansive fungril network and hunt for treasure remotely, disrupting Sprout’s connection to the fungril network. And on their way to the kingdom, there will be no waiting around for the perfect opportune moment to act, because Marigold has a set of powerful elemental leaders hot on her trail. ACT ONE: COLLISION Let’s make an event collide with our party that they can’t ignore. It’s often best to go to the most obvious answers first, then complicate things from there. In this case, let’s set up Maverick going after an artifact that the party has been asked to protect. If he’s using the fungril network to do it, then perhaps Maverick has Yaro create plantlike creatures filled with the fungus that he can control! There’s our first act encounter—and we can build the rest of this act from there. The most important thing to keep in mind about Act One is that you want to use it to introduce a bigger conflict the party will encounter later—give them a taste of what’s to come and draw them into the arc’s story. Using the techniques in the earlier “Running a Session” section, after you’ve played through Act One with your table, you might end up with something like this: Beat One: On their way to the city of Helayre, the party runs across the damage left behind by elementals—Marigold recognizes the work of those chasing her. Beat Two: As the party arrives in Helayre, they notice that large plants have overwhelmed everything. They also meet kind townsfolk who tell them about the attacks on the city by plant creatures at night. Upon inquiry, they’ll be taken to where the attacks are the worst—the university. Beat Three: At the university, the students all know Barnabas by name—the headmistress, Olivia Rose, is a proponent of his work. She shows the party what the plant creatures are after: the Stone Soul, belonging to a griffin from the hidden island of Boga Tiren. Olivia’s parents disappeared searching for Boga Tiren when she was a kid, and she has spent her life looking for them. If they extract the memory of its location from one of the plant creatures, then maybe she can find the island. Beat Four: Olivia captured a plant creature that attacked. When Sprout uses Death Connection, she learns it’s full of tiny mushrooms. She gets clearer flashes of the mage in a nearby port town. He cries out for help, looking pained. The mage is consumed by a memory in which a voice tells him to “get to the stone.” Beat Five: Plant creatures descend on the university. The party must hold them back and defend the Stone Soul. As the final creature goes down in battle, the party hears the mage’s voice seep through it—the voice calls out to Jasper with a nickname familiar only to Yaro. With the planet creatures defeated and Yaro revealed, Act One is complete. Though the party’s decisions might require you to adapt or make changes, this framework will help you use Act One to set up the rest of the arc. It creates questions for the PCs to chase—why is Yaro doing this? Why did he sound scared? Who was giving him orders? Could it be Maverick, looking for relics? And also—Where is Boga Tiren? Why is it hidden? Dramatic questions like these drive the PCs forward into Act Two. 189 Chapter 3: Running a Campaign"

Dramatic questions like these drive the PCs forward into Act Two. 189 Chapter 3: Running a Campaign\n-- 190 of 415 --\nACT TWO: COMPLICATIONS In Act Two, the PCs are thrust into a journey to answer their big questions. Before the end of Act One, you should confirm which direction they’re going to go before you dive into planning—they’ll almost certainly want to figure out what’s happening with Mage Yaro, but what if they decide to instead escort Professor Rose to Boga Tiren? Or something else entirely? It’s often best to lead from behind as you approach Act Two—let the players show you the questions they want to answer most, then fill in the gaps as they move toward finding those answers. Once the party is off on this quest, Act Two is all about the complications that get in the way. As you prep for these next sessions, the complications should matter—they should be personal and speak to the themes and tone of the campaign. If, for example, the party decides to head north to the Galamore kingdom to find out what’s happening with Mage Yaro, we know they’ll be on the road for a few days to get up there. It might be tempting to throw in a few random encounters with wild animals, some people asking for help with unrelated issues, or some rolls to see how well they’re able to survive the distant travel, but Act Two is all about building up to a climactic finale. So what can we do instead to make it feel like a story, rather than just time passing before we get to the Galamore kingdom? We know Barnabas is searching for the legendary dragon Krugthar, and we’re likely going to have a future arc (when the players are higher level) centered around his attack on Bloomfare (Marigold’s home). One option is to foreshadow that event and show the dragon’s power. Maybe we put a village decimated by fire on their path, the village’s mage dead and the ruins gouged with immense claw marks. Those alive talk about an attack by a massive flying beast that disappeared into the sun—something Barnabas will immediately recognize as Krugthar. But to give the players something to act on now, maybe the beast had small companions or minions that could be creating havoc in the village, dragging important NPCs into the forest, or shapeshifting to replace normal citizens. You can change this encounter depending on the kind of challenge your table enjoys. We also know from Sprout’s backstory that if she stays somewhere too long, she rots away everything around her— perhaps we see the devastating effect that Maverick and Yaro had on the environment. Perhaps the party encounters twisted arcane creatures riddled with fungus and struggles to traverse a sickly land. These events serve as a reminder to Sprout of the place she decimated and the destruction she left behind. She could have the chance at a bit of redemption here, or at least knowledge of this kind of blight that helps keep her friends safe. Another option might be to encounter an additional place where Maverick’s fungril creatures successfully stole another artifact of power—but this relic is something that can be consumed to steal another person’s arcane power. Perhaps we decide this was the plan along, for Maverick to use Yaro until he could absorb his magic himself. Even without knowing the full context, the PCs will likely rush to the Galamore kingdom as fast as they can, knowing this powerful object has fallen into the wrong hands. Whatever the journey may entail, once the PCs have reached the kingdom to confront Yaro and learn about Maverick, we enter the final act of our arc. ACT THREE: CLIMAX Act Three will usually see our PCs resolve some of the big questions they have and face off against the powerful force they’ve been preparing for through Act One and Act Two. Identify which answers the players are most excited about discovering and provide at least some of those answers in this act. Oftentimes, these answers are what launch the next arc of your campaign—having an idea of what they are going into this act will help you prepare for what’s to come. Though not absolutely mandatory, it’s also always a good idea to plan some sort of reveal, surprise, or twist in this act— something that isn’t quite what it seems. These plot twists keep the players on their toes and make them excited to find out what will happen next. In the case of our current example, we have a few twists prepared—Yaro is being controlled by Maverick, who has squirmed his way into the kingdom by marrying Astrid Galamore, Jasper’s childhood love. As we prepare this act, we should identify the questions we are going to answer—things like “Who is forcing Yaro to do this?” and “What happened to Astrid?” It’s important to think through what Maverick would do to keep himself safe and Yaro under his control. Perhaps he orders the king’s guard to attack the party when they enter the city, putting Jasper in conflict with the very people they grew up with. Maybe the kingdom is locked down and the drawbridge raised, forcing the group to find another way in. Think about how you can create a last set of complications that ramps up the tension until the final confrontation is inevitable. The arc will end with a showdown between Maverick and the party. Maybe he still has Yaro under his control and uses the mage as a weapon against them. Maybe he has absorbed Yaro’s arcane power using the relic he stole and is now attacking the party with magic himself. Maybe he has turned coward and is attempting to flee with Astrid through a secret tunnel beneath the castle. Whatever the encounter is, it should be a big, exciting, and dangerous ending to the arc that ties up some of the loose ends and creates an opportunity for more adventure in the next arc. 190 Chapter 3: Running a Campaign"

The shape of your campaign will depend on your campaign frame (whether you’re using a formal frame or not)—a campaign focused on the PCs rising to prominence as gladiators in one city-state will have a different shape than a grand tour campaign where PCs travel the world collecting the artifacts needed to defeat a world-ending threat. Some campaigns may be more episodic, with individual and seemingly disconnected adventures that eventually culminate into a larger story, and others might be a more serial narrative of unfolding arcs. Depending on your campaign, each story arc might end in the party leveling up, or a story arc might span across an entire tier of play (levels 2 through 4, 5 through 7, etc.). There’s no wrong way to plan as long as it serves your needs as a GM and the players are enjoying the game. A longer campaign (closer to eight to ten sessions per level) may have several story arcs per level or more complex story arcs, plots with red herrings or tough choices that force the PCs to decide between simultaneous threats. Then you can take the plots that the players did not focus on and progress them so that when the PCs do get around to addressing them, the situations have escalated. A few sessions into a campaign, once everyone has a solid sense of their characters and their motivations, you can explore options for longer-term planning and how to help the group execute on the table’s creative intentions for the campaign. Look at the background answers and connections, especially ones that haven’t yet been explored. Ask yourself how these elements could work with what’s already happened in the story. If a central character relationship between PCs already changed, what external events or situations could enrich or complicate that relationship? What elements of character backstory could provide dramatic contrast to how a character has presented themselves so far? What elements of the setting would be impacted by what’s already happened in the story? What threats have grown while the PCs were taking action elsewhere? CONSTRUCTING ARCS Imagine a rope. You have dozens of smaller cords twisted around one another to create something stronger and longer lasting than any one thread could be as an individual. That rope is a story arc, and the cords are the plots that weave together to craft it. While the rope always starts frayed, the cords tighten around one another as the story unfolds to create a cohesive and satisfying narrative. We build story arcs by breaking them into three or four sessions that each cover a major plot beat. These beats are created when we intertwine several ongoing storylines, which we’ll call A-, B-, and C-plots. As you chart out arcs, you’ll determine which storylines to prioritize when they best deserve focus. By threading storylines into beats, then those beats into arcs, you can weave the arcs together into one thrilling, cohesive campaign. A-PLOT: The star of the show, often dealing with the primary action of a session. Early in a campaign, this typically involves taking the first steps into revealing a larger world and a looming threat. As a campaign moves forward, A-plots will fall away as B- and C-plots rise into their place. B-PLOT: This plot is flexible and often throws a wrench into the gears turning the A-plot, forcing the party to divert their attention. The B-plot in one arc should become the A-plot in the next. C-PLOT: The least-featured plot thread in an arc or beat, the C-Plot exists to seed upcoming and important plot threads. These are best used sparingly—you’ll know you did it right when a late-campaign revelation has a trail of breadcrumbs, only visible in hindsight, leading back to some of the earliest story points. C-plots often become B-plots in subsequent arcs. You can always inject a D/E/F-plot into the story if it calls for it. But even if you have more than three major plot threads in your story, focusing on three in any given session will help keep everything manageable. In the table below, you’ll see four example narratives: “Marigold’s Four Elementals,” “Sprout’s Power,” “Krugthar’s Destruction,” and “Yaro’s Return,” and how they might weave together into a three-arc campaign. A LARGER PLOT When you run a campaign, you might prefer to have PCs explore a number of smaller arcs using the structure above. You can also nest this structure within one overarching plot. In heroic adventures, this often manifests as a quest to stop the villain, protect the kingdom, or save the world—a challenge the PCs must overcome that affects the wider world and the people in it. If you want to include a larger plot, it will appear more or less in each session, remaining throughout your story until the characters finally arrive at the climax of the campaign.

Using Adversaries This section describes how to use each adversary’s stat block, while the “Armed Conflict” section in chapter 3 presents general rules for running combat and tying these scenes into the larger story. Finally, the upcoming “Adversary Stat Blocks” section presents statistics for each adversary, grouped by tier to represent their general threat level. ADVERSARY BREAKDOWN Each adversary’s stat block presents the statistics, or mechanical information, you need to use them in combat. Name Each stat block has a unique name—see the Jagged Knife Bandit stat block example below. Abilities that affect adversaries with a certain name include all adversaries who use that stat block, regardless of their in-story name. Tier Each adversary is designed to oppose PCs of a certain tier. You can use stat blocks from other tiers, but you might want to adjust their statistics as described in the upcoming “Improvising Adversaries” section. Tier 1 adversaries are appropriate for level 1 characters, Tier 2 for levels 2–4, Tier 3 for levels 5–7, and Tier 4 for levels 8–10. Type The adversary’s type appears alongside their tier. The Jagged Knife Bandit is a Standard adversary, meaning they’re an average member of their faction’s forces. The following “Adversary Types” section details possible adversary roles. Description A summary of the adversary’s appearance and demeanor. Motives & Tactics Each stat block contains the adversary’s motives and tactics. When in doubt, the bandit tries to escape (caring more for their own life than victory), profit (by any means necessary, including lying and stealing), and throw smoke (obscuring the battlefield and escape route). These motives and tactics are suggestions rather than rules—feel free to improvise their choices as you would when playing any NPC. Difficulty Adversaries don’t use Evasion like PCs—instead, all rolls against them use their Difficulty. The bandit has a Difficulty of 12, so a roll of 12 or higher succeeds against this adversary. If an adversary’s feature doesn’t specify a Difficulty (like an Agility Reaction Roll), it always uses the adversary’s Difficulty. Damage Thresholds, Hit Points, and Stress “Thresholds: 8/14” represents this adversary’s damage thresholds—so their Major threshold is 8 and their Severe threshold is 14. The bandit has 5 Hit Points and 3 Stress. These systems function the same way they do for PCs. Attack Modifier When you attack with the adversary, apply this bonus or penalty to your attack roll. Standard Attack Each adversary has a standard attack listed next to their attack modifier, which contains the attack’s name (Daggers), its range (Melee), and its damage on a success (1d8+1 physical damage). You can use this standard attack as an action. Experience Like PCs, some adversaries have Experiences that make them especially capable in certain situations. This adversary’s Experience is Thief +2, which can aid them in rolls related to skulduggery. See the upcoming “Adversary Experiences” section for further details. Features Features represent the bandit’s capabilities in a conflict. There are three kinds of features: passives, actions, and reactions. For example, the bandit has a passive called “From Above” that deals more damage when they’re attacking from above— the 1d10+1 damage replaces their standard attack’s 1d8+1. The upcoming “Adversary Features” section details how to use various features. JAGGED KNIFE BANDIT Tier  Standard A cunning criminal in a cloak bearing one of the gang’s iconic knives. Motives & Tactics: Escape, profi t, steal, throw smoke Difficulty: 12 | Thresholds: 8/14 | HP: 5 | Stress: 3 ATK: +1 | Daggers: Melee | 1d8+1 phy Experience: Thief +2 FEATURES Climber - Passive: The Bandit climbs just as easily as they run. From Above - Passive: When the Bandit succeeds on a standard attack from above a target, they deal 1d10+1 physical damage instead of their standard damage. 193 Chapter 4: Adversaries and Environments"

When building encounters, utilizing a mix of types helps create a dynamic and engaging challenge. The adversary types are as follows: • Bruisers are tough and deliver powerful attacks. • Hordes are groups of identical creatures acting together as a single unit. • Leaders command and summon other adversaries. • Minions are easily dispatched but dangerous in numbers. • Ranged are fragile in close encounters but can attack from a distance for high damage. • Skulks maneuver and exploit opportunities to ambush opponents. • Socials present unique challenges to overcome through conversation rather than combat. • Solos present a formidable challenge to a whole party, with or without support. • Standards are rank-and-file adversaries representative of their fictional group. • Supports enhance their allies and disrupt their opponents. ADVERSARY EXPERIENCES Adversaries tend to have fewer but broader Experiences than PCs. In situations where you think an adversary’s capabilities would come into play, you can spend a Fear to apply an Experience modifier to their Difficulty, attack rolls, and reaction rolls as follows: Difficulty When a PC makes an action roll against an adversary, you can spend a Fear to add a relevant Experience modifier to the roll’s Difficulty. Adversary Attack and Reaction Rolls When an adversary makes an attack or reaction roll, you can spend a Fear to add a relevant Experience modifier to the roll. When you use an adversary’s Experience, describe how it improves their odds at performing that action. Experiences feel more impactful if you save them for certain dramatic moments or situations, rather than applying them to most rolls. While some adversaries specialize in combat, others do best in nonviolent situations, and their Experiences reflect that. For example, the Tier 1 Merchant has the Experience “Shrewd Negotiator +3” that can apply whenever a PC tries to haggle with them, increasing the Difficulty to 15 to reflect their keen business acumen. Example Experiences You can always adjust a stat block’s Experiences to fit your story. Here are examples of Experiences you can use: Acrobatics Hunt from Above Navigation Ambusher Intimidation Nobility Bartering Intrusion Quick Reflexes Blademaster Keen Senses Socialite Bodyguard Magical Knowledge Stealth Commander Nature’s Friend Tracker ADVERSARY FEATURES The bottom of each stat block lists the adversary’s features. Features can take three forms—actions, reactions, and passives. The following sections describe how to use these features and provide a few examples. Tip: If an adversary stat block mentions an “ally,” it’s referring to a fellow adversary, not a PC. Activating Features For an adversary to use an action, they must have the spotlight. Passives and reactions typically don’t require the spotlight. Some features require you to use additional resources, such as: • Marking Stress Some moves call for you to “mark a Stress,” meaning you mark 1 Stress on the adversary. Other, more powerful moves might tell you to “mark 2 Stress” or more. Each adversary’s Stress is tracked individually; if one adversary marks all their Stress, they can’t mark a different adversary’s Stress to use that move. • Spending Fear Some moves say to “spend a Fear.” Other, more powerful moves might tell you to “spend 2 Fear” or more. To make one of these moves, you must spend Fear as described, even if you already spent a Fear to spotlight the adversary. Adversary Tokens Some adversaries require tokens to be placed on their stat blocks for certain features. These adversary tokens are used as counters similar to the players’ character tokens. 194 Chapter 4: Using Adversaries"

This includes their attack modifier, the name of the attack, its range, and its damage. When you spotlight an adversary, you can always use their standard attack as long as they are within range or can move within range. • Unique Actions Many adversaries have special actions listed on the bottom of their stat block. These represent their innate abilities, magical talents, and other combat techniques. Unique actions might allow the adversary to make an attack, force PCs to make a reaction roll, or even change the landscape. When you spotlight an adversary, you can choose to use one of these instead of making a standard attack. • Other Actions Adversaries can do nearly anything a PC can, so if you want to do something that isn’t in the stat block, feel free! The “Adversary Action Rolls” section in chapter 3 provides guidance for resolving other actions an adversary might take. UNIQUE ACTION EXAMPLES The following features are examples of unique actions. In these examples, “X” represents a number that differs for each stat block. Haymaker - Action: Make an attack against a target within Very Close range. On a success, deal X direct physical damage. Shredding Strike - Action: Make an attack against a target within Very Close range. On a success, deal X physical damage and the target must mark an Armor Slot without gaining its benefit (they can still use armor to reduce the damage). Adversary Reactions Adversary reactions are features that don’t take effect until their specific trigger occurs (such as taking damage or marking a certain number of HP). When it triggers, you can choose to immediately use the reaction, and you don’t have to spend Fear to interrupt the PCs with this reaction (unless otherwise specified). The following features are examples of reactions. In these examples, “X” represents a number that differs for each stat block. Heavy Hitter - Reaction: When this adversary deals damage with a standard attack, you can spend a Fear to gain a +X bonus to the damage roll. Team-Up - Reaction: When another adversary within Very Close range of thisadversary deals X damage to a creature, you can mark a Stress to make a standard attack against that same creature. On a success, combine the damage. Momentum - Reaction: When this adversary makes a successful attack against a PC, you gain a Fear. Adversary Passives Adversary passives always apply under the circumstances stated in that feature. Some are always in effect (such as the “Arcane Form” passive, which makes the adversary permanently resistant to magic damage). Others automatically come into effect when the stated trigger occurs (such as the “Horde” passive, which reduces the adversary’s damage once their Hit Points are halved). The following features are examples of passives. In these examples, “X” represents a number that differs for each stat block. Horde (X) - Passive: When the Horde has marked half or more of their HP, their standard attack deals X damage instead. Minion (X) - Passive: This adversary is defeated when they take any damage. For every X damage a PC deals to this adversary, defeat an additional Minion within range the attack would succeed against. Relentless (X) - Passive: This adversary can be spotlighted up to X times per GM turn. Spend Fear as usual to spotlight them. Tip: The “Relentless” feature is useful if you want an adversary who can act multiple times between PCs. This is often best for exceedingly fast or dangerous foes, or for adversaries who are likely to battle the party on their own. Slow - Passive: When you spotlight this adversary and they don’t have a token on their stat block, they can’t act yet. Place a token on their stat block and describe what they’re preparing to do. When you spotlight this adversary and they have a token on their stat block, clear the token and they can act. Tip: The “Slow” feature is useful if you want an adversary who narratively takes longer to act than others, like a giant slug or a lumbering ogre. This is usually most effective when the creature has powerful actions that justify the delay. Arcane Form - Passive: This adversary is resistant to magic damage. Armored Carapace - Passive: When this adversary takes physical damage, reduce it by X. 195 Chapter 4: Using Adversaries"

These can take the form of passives, actions, or reactions. Each Fear Feature is a scene- defining effect that justifies the expenditure of this valuable GM resource. Explosion - Action: Spend a Fear to erupt in a fiery explosion. Make an attack against all targets within Close range. Targets the adversary succeeds against take 1d8 magic damage and are knocked back to Far range. Summoning Features Certain features summon additional adversaries on the battlefield. The summoned adversaries arrive at a specified range relative to the adversary who used the feature. In the following example, the Jagged Knife Lackeys would spawn at Far range from the Leader who summoned them. We recommend you use these features when you feel the fight needs to grow—either in duration or difficulty. More Where That Came From - Action: Summon three Jagged Knife Lackeys, who appear at Far range. Spotlighting Features Some features allow you to immediately spotlight one or more other adversaries. Unless otherwise specified, this doesn’t require spending Fear. When a feature tells you to spotlight more than one adversary, you can choose the order in which they act. While an adversary is spotlighted in this way, you can’t use another spotlighting feature. Tactician - Action: Mark a Stress to spotlight this adversary and two allies within Close range. RETURNING RULES This section repeats a few rules from earlier chapters that are helpful to remember while running adversaries. Targets and Groups Often an effect asks you to choose a target within range. This means you choose a single creature to affect. When it makes sense in the story, you can target a single object in range, rather than a creature, adjusting the effects as needed. To affect a group of targets, those targets must be clumped together in an area within Very Close range of a point you choose. Regardless of the number of targets, you only need to make one attack roll and compare that total to the Difficulty of each eligible target to determine which creatures you succeed against. When your attack deals damage to more than one target, roll damage once and apply the total to each target the attack succeeded against. Attacking Multiple Targets By default, an adversary can only hit one target with their standard attack. When an adversary’s action lets you make an attack against multiple targets, you make one attack roll and ask if it hits any of the targets. If you’re making individual attacks with multiple adversaries during the same GM move, make an attack roll for each adversary. 196 Chapter 4: Using Adversaries"

The upcoming “Battle Guide” section gives a starting point for building balanced encounters. The following pages break down each type of adversary and provide guidance for building your own. BATTLE GUIDE This guide will help you roughly balance an encounter so you can determine how many and which adversaries to use. You’ll first calculate your starting Battle Points, which determine your budget for the encounter. Then you’ll adjust the budget up and down based on other factors. Finally, you’ll build the encounter, spending Battle Points to add adversaries until you have no more to spend. When planning a battle, start with the following formula to calculate how many Battle Points you should spend: (3 × the number of PCs in combat) + 2 For example, if you have a party of three PCs, you have 11 Battle Points to spend. If you have a party of five, you have 17 Battle Points to spend. Keep in mind that you might need to adjust this calculation as you become more acquainted with your party and their power level. Adjusting Battle Points Some factors might increase or decrease your Battle Points budget: • Subtract 1 point if the fight should be less difficult or shorter. • Subtract 2 points if you’re using 2 or more Solo adversaries. • Subtract 2 points if you add +1d4 (or a static +2) to all adversaries’ damage rolls (to increase the challenge without lengthening the battle). • Add 1 point if you choose an adversary from a lower tier. • Add 1 point if you don’t include any Bruisers, Hordes, Leaders, or Solos. • Add 2 points if the fight should be more dangerous or last longer. Spending Battle Points Once you finish calculating your available Battle Points, craft your combat encounter by spending points until you have none left. • Spend 1 point for each group of Minions equal to the size of the party. • Spend 1 point for each Social or Support adversary. • Spend 2 points for each Horde, Ranged, Skulk, or Standard adversary. • Spend 3 points for each Leader adversary. • Spend 4 points for each Bruiser adversary. • Spend 5 points for each Solo adversary. Tip: Some adversaries summon additional enemies when they use their features—you don’t need to factor those into your point total. Example: Ben is preparing an encounter for his party of four to help introduce a new enemy faction. Having four PCs means he starts with 14 Battle Points to spend. He wants this encounter to be a little easier, so he adjusts his Battle Points to 13. He spends 8 points on two Bruisers, 4 points on two Standards, and 1 point on four Minions. Later, the party has followed the faction’s trail and confronts a group on patrol near the faction’s outpost. Ben spends 10 points on five Standard adversaries, 2 points on a Ranged adversary, and 2 points on eight Minions. And finally, because the party has fought through the outpost to confront the faction leader, Ben decides to make the last fight more difficult. He decides he will add +2 to all adversary’s damage rolls, giving him 12 points to spend. With this budget, he spends 3 points on a Leader, 4 points on a Bruiser, 4 points on two Hordes, and 1 point on a Support. The Leader also has an action that can bring in Minions as needed. 197 Chapter 4: Choosing Adversaries"

These heavyweights can take significant punishment and deal powerful blows. Mechanics Bruisers are close-quarter combatants. They usually engage the party’s melee characters while other adversaries attack from range. They deal high damage and often use area attacks. Sometimes they have the “Slow” feature to play up their lumbering nature, or features that move the PCs around to display their power. If you’re using minis in your encounters, consider ones with larger bases to convey their size—bigger minis usually imply a larger threat! Archetypal Example The Minotaur Wrecker is a paramount example of the Bruiser: big, lumbering, and extremely dangerous. At Tier 2, these juggernauts typically deal Major damage and can land Severe blows on more lightly armored PCs. Their “Ramp Up” passive means they’re more costly to spotlight, but they can attack all targets within range with their standard attack. With their “Gore” action, they charge into combat and make big dents in armored units. Custom Bruisers When creating a Bruiser, keep in mind the following guidelines. Offensively, a Bruiser’s attack modifiers are usually average or lower, and most of their attacks deal Major or Severe damage (as appropriate for their tier). Defensively, they have average or lower Difficulty, higher than average Hit Points, and slightly higher than average damage thresholds. Making Your Own Imagine an ogre rising from the grave—let’s call them a Dire Wight! This hulking creature might be found feasting on their latest kill or patrolling the outskirts of an ancient castle. This powerful guardian carries a terrifying two-handed mace enchanted with the last cries of their victims. We’ll make them at Tier 3. • Since the wight is a larger, lumbering creature and thus easy to target, a Difficulty of 15 works well. • We want to make the wight easier to hit, but harder to damage, so let's give them a Major threshold of 26, and a Severe threshold of 42. We can also give them 8 HP and 4 Stress. • Because they are so big, the wight doesn’t attack as accurately, giving them a slightly below-average attack modifier of +2. • The damage from these attacks should always have an impact when they connect, so we’ll use the impressive damage pool of 3d12+5. • Because we want them to feel reckless and powerful, let’s make their Experience a +3 in Throw. • The wight wields a massive weapon, so taking a swing at multiple targets is a fitting action. The weapon’s frightening nature might have an effect as well, so let’s have it cause PCs to mark a Stress when it hits. We can also play up the wight’s undead nature by saying that heavy-hitting attacks against this foe have an unnerving effect on the PCs, as they watch the creature’s rotting skin split open. To make it less overpowered, let’s make the feature cost the wight a Stress. A Bruiser adversary with these features might look like this: DIRE WIGHT Tier  Bruiser An undead ogre protective of their territory. Motives & Tactics: Kill, obey, protect, terrify Difficulty: 15 | Thresholds: 26/42 | HP: 8 | Stress: 4 ATK: +2 | Claws and Teeth: Very Close | 3d12+5 phy Experience: Throw +3 FEATURES Terrifying Swing - Action: Spend a Fear to force all targets within Very Close range to mark a Stress, then make an attack against them. Targets the Wight succeeds against take 3d10+1 physical damage. Splitting Skin - Reaction: When the Wight takes Major or greater damage, you can mark a Stress to force all targets within Very Close range to make a Presence Reaction Roll. Targets who fail lose a Hope and are knocked back to Close range. MINOTAUR WRECKER Tier  Bruiser A massive bull-headed fi rbolg with a quick temper. Motives & Tactics: Consume, gore, navigate, overpower, pursue Difficulty: 16 | Thresholds: 14/27 | HP: 7 | Stress: 5 ATK: +2 | Battleaxe: Very Close | 2d8+5 phy Experience: Navigation +2 FEATURES Ramp Up - Passive: You must spend a Fear to spotlight the Minotaur. While spotlighted, they can make their standard attack against all targets within range. Charging Bull - Action: Mark a Stress to charge through a group within Close range and make an attack against all targets in the Minotaur’s path. Targets the Minotaur succeeds against take 2d6+8 physical damage and are knocked back to Very Far range. If a target is knocked into a solid object or another creature, they take an extra 1d6 damage (combine the damage). Gore - Action: Make an attack against a target within Very Close range, moving the Minotaur into Melee range of them. On a success, deal 2d8 direct physical damage. 198 Chapter 4: Choosing Adversaries"

Mechanics Hordes are groups of weaker enemies. They deal high damage initially, but less once they’ve marked at least half of their Hit Points (rounded up). Many of them have interesting passives or reactions that capture their role in the fiction. Every Horde has the “Horde” passive, which is unique to this adversary type: Horde (X) - Passive: When the Horde has marked half or more of their HP, their standard attack deals X damage instead. Hordes also have a unique notation of (Y/HP) next to their type in their stat block. The Y represents the number of creatures represented by each Hit Point the Horde has. For example, 2/HP means that every Hit Point represents two members of the Horde. This narrative detail allows you to quickly describe the number of foes brought down with each attack. For example, if a PC deals 2 Hit Points to the Horde, they take down four enemies with their attack. Hordes work well in theater-of-the-mind play because you only need to use a single unit in combat to represent many foes. Archetypal Example While every Horde has the same basic mechanics, the Zombie Pack is a good example of how to capture the fiction with those features. Their damage is near the top of the tier, but they’re less likely to hit with their −1 attack modifier. Since the Horde’s purpose in the narrative is to overwhelm the characters, it’s fitting that the Zombie Pack has a reaction called “Overwhelm” that allows them to mark a Stress and attack a creature who struck them. Custom Hordes Hordes have low Difficulty and attack modifiers, as well as average damage thresholds. Their damage is initially high, then drops by about half once they’ve taken substantial damage. Making Your Own Delving deep into magical mines sometimes exacts a price more permanent than exhaustion. The spirits of miners that perished as a result of their own greed still linger, ever covetous. We’ll make them at Tier 3. • Because of their large numbers, the miners are much easier to hit. However, they’re also ghostly, so their Difficulty might be only slightly lower than average at a 16. • We’ll put their thresholds on the low end at Major 15/ Severe 25, as their ties to the Mortal Realm are tenuous. Additionally, we’ll give them 6 Hit Points and 3 Stress. • These miners might have some skill with their tools, but they aren’t trained for combat. At best, they might have a +1 attack modifier. • As these ghosts once did in life, they exploit any weakness. Their attacks are devastating because of their numbers. Putting their standard attack at 3d12+10 means they deal high damage, which drops to 3d6+5 when they’re at half HP or fewer. • Trapped by their greed, the miners are obsessed with gaining wealth. Giving them a feature that demonstrates their ravenous hunger against targets with gold plays into the fiction we’ve established. A Horde adversary with these traits might look like this: COVETOUS MINERS Tier  Horde (/HP) A ghostly group of miners trapped by their insatiable greed. Motives & Tactics: Be free, gain wealth, pay debts Difficulty: 16 | Thresholds: 15/25 | HP: 6 | Stress: 3 ATK: +1 | Soul Mattock: Melee | 3d12+10 mag FEATURES Horde (3d6+5) - Passive: When the Miners have marked half or more of their HP, their standard attack deals 3d6+5 magic damage instead. Hunger for Gold - Action: Mark a Stress to make a standard attack with advantage against all targets carrying gold within Very Close range. ZOMBIE PACK Tier  Horde (/HP) A group of shambling corpses instinctively moving together. Motives & Tactics: Consume fl esh, hunger, maul Difficulty: 8 | Thresholds: 6/12 | HP: 6 | Stress: 3 ATK: −1 | Bite: Melee | 1d10+2 phy FEATURES Horde (1d4+2) - Passive: When the Zombies have marked half or more of their HP, their standard attack deals 1d4+2 physical damage instead. Overwhelm - Reaction: When the Zombies mark HP from an attack within Melee range, you can mark a Stress to make a standard attack against the attacker. 199 Chapter 4: Choosing Adversaries"

This adversary could be the boss of a local thieves’ guild or an evil knight whose army lays waste to the countryside. They bring the strength of their forces to bear against those who oppose them. Mechanics A Leader can spotlight multiple allies in one move, buff them, or summon new combatants to the field, and they create dynamic combat by rallying and maneuvering their forces. But a Leader is also dangerous in their own right—they usually have some of the highest attributes for their tier of play, making them difficult to hit, harder to take down, and deadly when they land a blow. When you build an encounter with a Leader, the most important thing you can do to sell the fiction is to see what types of features they use and pair them with other adversaries who take advantage of those features. Archetypal Example The Head Guard is an iconic Leader. Their “On My Signal” reaction starts a countdown that commands Archer Guards to attack with advantage against targets near them. However, this feature doesn’t function when there are no Archer Guards present in the scene. When attacking on their own, a Head Guard generally deals Major damage to Tier 1 PCs, but you can spend 2 Fear to use their “Rally Guards” action, spotlighting them and some of their allies to deal more damage. Because the cost for “Rally Guards” is so high, having enough allies for the Head Guard to take advantage of it is paramount. This is true for most Leaders—they need sufficient forces to be the greatest threat. Custom Leaders A Leader should have stats that surpass those of other adversaries in the same tier. These adversaries are difficult to defeat because they deal more damage, have higher damage thresholds, and have a higher Difficulty. Their main weakness is that much of their strength comes from their allies. Take those away and a Leader will struggle. Making Your Own Wildborne bandit gangs are sometimes led by thieves known as Briarwhips. These experienced rangers know the verdant woods and its bounty. When word of well-guarded treasure reaches a gang, a Briarwhip is chosen to lead the heist. We’ll make them at Tier 1. • They are fierce and nimble rangers, so a Difficulty of 14 suits them. You could let them increase their Difficulty, similar to the Bone domain’s “Ferocity” feature. • They wear scale-like stone armor that would give them higher damage thresholds. Let’s do Major 9/Severe 14. Additionally, we’ll give them 6 HP and 4 Stress. • They have deadly accuracy with their whip, giving them an attack modifier of +3. • They attach poisoned thorns to their whip, so their weapon deals more damage, but the application might be less consistent. To represent this, we choose to use 1d10+2 for their damage. • We’ll give them a few Experiences that reflect both their Leader type and their background as a ranger. • They command their subordinates through the use of hand signals or whistles. Giving them the ability to command their allies to slink back into the underbrush could be a great Fear Feature, but consider how that would change the scene. If all their allies are Hidden, the Briarwhip would become the characters’ only target, so we want to give them the ability to take the hits headed their way. Borrowing from the Bone domain’s “Brace” feature, we can have them mark a Stress to lessen the blow. A Leader adversary with these traits might look like this: BRIARWHIP Tier  Leader A cunning and capable ranger who takes on the most dangerous missions. Motives & Tactics: Explore, plan, protect, steal Difficulty: 14 | Thresholds: 9/14 | HP: 6 | Stress: 4 ATK: +3 | Poisoned Briarwhip: Close | 1d10+2 phy Experience: Hide +2, Intimidation +2, Track +3 FEATURES Ferocious Defense - Passive: When an attack from the Briarwhip causes a target to mark HP, the Briarwhip gains a +1 bonus to their Difficulty until they mark 1 or more HP. Into the Bramble - Action: Spend a Fear to spotlight up to 1d4 allies within Far range. They move to cover within Close range and become Hidden until after their next attack or a PC succeeds on an Instinct Roll to fi nd them. Brace - Reaction: When the Briarwhip marks 1 or more HP, you can mark a Stress to mark 1 fewer HP. HEAD GUARD Tier  Leader A seasoned guard with a mace, a whistle, and a bellowing voice. Motives & Tactics: Arrest, close gates, pin down, seek glory Difficulty: 15 | Thresholds: 7/13 | HP: 7 | Stress: 3 ATK: +4 | Mace: Melee | 1d10+4 phy Experience: Commander +2, Local Knowledge +2 FEATURES Rally Guards - Action: Spend 2 Fear to spotlight the Head Guard and up to 2d4 allies within Far range. On My Signal - Reaction: Countdown (5). When the Head Guard is in the spotlight for the fi rst time, activate the countdown. It ticks down when a PC makes an attack roll. When it triggers, all Archer Guards within Far range make a standard attack with advantage against the nearest target within their range. If any attacks succeed on the same target, combine their damage. Momentum - Reaction: When the Head Guard makes a successful attack against a PC, you gain a Fear. 200 Chapter 4: Choosing Adversaries"

Mechanics Each Minion has 1 Hit Point and the following features: Minion (X) - Passive: This adversary is defeated when they take any damage. For every X damage a PC deals to this adversary, defeat an additional Minion within range the attack would succeed against. Group Attack - Action: Spend a Fear to choose a target and spotlight all adversaries with this name within a certain range of them. Those Minions move into Melee range of the target and make one shared attack roll. On a success, they deal X damage each. Combine this damage. The “Minion” passive creates cinematic experiences at the table while ensuring these adversaries are easily defeated. Each Minion has a different amount of damage that triggers their \"Minion” passive, as defined by the number in the feature’s heading. For example, the Giant Rat’s feature says “Minion (3),” which means that if an attack deals 3 damage to them, the initial target is destroyed, and another Minion within range who the attack roll would succeed against is also defeated. At 6 damage, two additional Minions within range are defeated, and so on. Tell the attacking PC which other Minions within range the attack would succeed against and let them choose which Minions they defeat. For example, if a PC deals 3 damage to a Giant Rat (Difficulty 10) and there’s a Rotted Zombie (Difficulty 8) nearby, the PC can choose to defeat the Rotted Zombie in addition to the initial Giant Rat. It’s important to note that some weapons have greater range than others, making ranged attackers very effective against Minions. The “Group Attack” action allows the Minions to attack using only one roll. This speeds up play significantly, as you simply add up the damage of many attacks rather than rolling for each individual attack. Because Minions are so easily defeated, keep the tier of play in mind when selecting which adversaries to make Minions—it might be immersion-breaking for a level 1 character to bring down a flight of dragons with one attack. Archetypal Example The Giant Rat is an example of a typical Minion. Other than the numbers in their stat blocks, Minions vary little from adversary to adversary, as they don’t tend to have other distinguishing features. When Minions do have unique features, they should be reserved for cinematic moves that make sense in the fiction (such as the Tangle Bramble Minion’s “Drain and Multiply” reaction) or stronger Minions (such as the Hallowed Soldier’s “Divine Flight” passive or the Fallen Shock Troop’s “Aura of Doom” passive). Custom Minions In addition to the previous information, Minions have lower Difficulty and do fixed damage. Making Your Own The Demon of Hubris is a Leader who demands perfection from those beneath them. Who might this sneering king of the Circles Below have as servants to lord over? Idolizing Imps that snivel and bow in deference make perfect sense. We’ll make them at Tier 3. • Minions tend to have a low Difficulty for their tier, but these are nimble adversaries, so we’ll give them a Difficulty of 17. • Because they are Minions, they have 1 HP and 1 Stress. • The imps spend their hours idolizing their leader and doing little else. An attack modifier of +0 feels appropriate. • You want Minions to do significant damage at the beginning of a combat, but much less as their numbers thin. Let’s do 7 physical damage per Minion. • In that case, they’re likely more fragile—we can incorporate that into their “Minion” passive so the PCs fell many of them in a single blow. “Minion (8)” feels appropriate. A Minion adversary with these traits might look like this: IDOLIZING IMP Tier  Minion A demon who bows in deference to their lord. Motives & Tactics: Defend, trick, worship Difficulty: 17 | Thresholds: None | HP: 1 | Stress: 1 ATK: +0 | Claws: Melee | 7 phy FEATURES Minion () - Passive: The Imp is defeated when they take any damage. For every 8 damage a PC deals to the Imp, defeat an additional Minion within range the attack would succeed against. Group Attack - Action: Spend a Fear to choose a target and spotlight all Idolizing Imps within Close range of them. Those Minions move into Melee range of the target and make one shared attack roll. On a success, they deal 7 physical damage each. Combine this damage. GIANT RAT Tier  Minion A cat-sized rodent skilled at scavenging and survival. Motives & Tactics: Burrow, hunger, scavenge, wear down Difficulty: 10 | Thresholds: None | HP: 1 | Stress: 1 ATK: −4 | Claws: Melee | 1 phy Experience: Keen Senses +3 FEATURES Minion (3) - Passive: The Rat is defeated when they take any damage. For every 3 damage a PC deals to the Rat, defeat an additional Minion within range the attack would succeed against. Group Attack - Action: Spend a Fear to choose a target and spotlight all Giant Rats within Close range of them. Those Minions move into Melee range of the target and make one shared attack roll. On a success, they deal 1 physical damage each. Combine this damage. 201 Chapter 4: Choosing Adversaries"

These enemies hit hard while staying away from direct conflict. Mechanics Because of their superior attack range, a Ranged adversary’s presence on the battlefield divides the characters’ attention. When positioning them, spread them out and put other threats between them and the party. Have them use the terrain to their advantage when they attack, keeping them on the edge of their effective range wherever possible. When you build encounters, consider the party’s abilities: Ranged adversaries work well against flying characters and can be difficult for melee-focused PCs to deal with. Archetypal Example A great example of a Ranged adversary is the War Wizard. This enemy doesn’t evoke the traditional idea of a Ranged enemy, but they have all the hallmarks of one: They can move within Far range, they deal lethal damage, and it would take two hits from most PCs to bring them down. It’s just a matter of getting to them. Custom Ranged These adversaries have higher than average attack modifiers, lower damage thresholds, and fewer Hit Points. They hit hard but go down quickly once engaged. Make Your Own In the frozen lands at the top of the world, survival is all that matters. To survive in the most dangerous places, a hunter must have ice in their veins and an unshakable nerve. The settlements in this bitter wasteland depend on these explorers to survive—the Icewaste Hunter is a hero to their people. We’ll make them at Tier 2. • A longbow would give a PC a −1 to their Evasion. Let’s incorporate that into our hunter by giving them an average Difficulty of 13. • These hardy survivors are keenly attuned to the frozen wastes. We can reflect that in their thresholds, Hit Points, and Stress by giving them the following stats: thresholds of Major 7/Severe 14, 5 Hit Points, and 4 Stress. • Hunters bring down dangerous foes from a distance, so our Ranged adversary needs a weapon that can hit hard from far away. We’ll give them a +3 to their attack. • They should deal high damage, often Major and sometimes Severe. A longbow that deals 2d12+6 damage fulfills these requirements. • Through years of training, hunters acquire skills that help them survive and use their surroundings to their advantage. We’ll reflect that in their Experiences. • Lastly, we’ll give them a few features that build on these Experiences, like taking cover and using traps. A Ranged adversary with these traits might look like this: ICEWASTE HUNTER Tier  Ranged A survivalist who travels the icy wastes in search of dangerous game. Motives & Tactics: Hunt, persevere, rescue, track Difficulty: 13 | Thresholds: 7/14 | HP: 5 | Stress: 4 ATK: +3 | Longbow: Far | 2d12+6 phy Experience: Navigate +2, Survivalist +3 FEATURES Steady Aim - Passive: Mark a Stress to give the Hunter advantage on their next attack. Snowblind Trap - Action: Spend a Fear to target a group within Close range. All targets must succeed on an Agility Reaction Roll or be caught in the trap, becoming Vulnerable until they escape with a successful Strength or Finesse (14) roll. You gain a Fear when a target who is caught in this trap makes an action roll. Take Cover! - Reaction: Mark a Stress to give an attack against the Hunter disadvantage. If the attack still succeeds, reduce the severity of the damage they take by one threshold. WAR WIZARD Tier  Ranged A battle-hardened mage trained in destructive magic. Motives & Tactics: Develop new spells, seek power, shatter formations Difficulty: 16 | Thresholds: 11/23 | HP: 5 | Stress: 6 ATK: +4 | Staff : Far | 2d10+4 mag Experience: Magical Knowledge +2, Strategize +2 FEATURES Battle Teleport - Passive: Before or after making a standard attack, you can mark a Stress to teleport to a location within Far range. Refresh Warding Sphere - Action: Mark a Stress to refresh the Wizard’s “Warding Sphere” reaction. Eruption - Action: Spend a Fear and choose a point within Far range. A Very Close area around that point erupts into impassable terrain. All targets within that area must make an Agility Reaction Roll (14). Targets who fail take 2d10 physical damage and are thrown out of the area. Targets who succeed take half damage and aren’t moved. Arcane Artillery - Action: Spend a Fear to unleash a precise hail of magical blasts. All targets in the scene must make an Agility Reaction Roll. Targets who fail take 2d12 magic damage. Targets who succeed take half damage. Warding Sphere - Reaction: When the Wizard takes damage from an attack within Close range, deal 2d6 magic damage to the attacker. This reaction can’t be used again until the Wizard refreshes it with their “Refresh Warding Sphere” action. 202 Chapter 4: Choosing Adversaries"

This reaction can’t be used again until the Wizard refreshes it with their “Refresh Warding Sphere” action. 202 Chapter 4: Choosing Adversaries\n-- 203 of 415 --\nSKULKS Skulks come in different types and have different abilities based on their lore. They can be ambushers who lurk in the shadows, skirmishers specializing in hit-and-run tactics, or elusive adversaries who confuse the party through mundane or magical means. Mechanics A wide breadth of adversaries can fit into the Skulk category, typically those who use misdirection and movement during combat. They might not do damage on every activation, instead opting to hinder the party’s ability to move freely through the battlefield or debilitate them with a temporary condition. There are several ways to take advantage of these adversaries in combat: you might open with an ambush from a group of Skulks, or a Leader might summon one midway through the battle, placing them close to PCs who try to stay away from the fight. Like Ranged adversaries, most Skulks don’t want to stay within Melee range; they strike and move away whenever possible. If you want your Skulks to be particularly cunning, they should ignore warriors, seraphs, and guardians, instead pursuing softer targets such as wizards and bards. Archetypal Example The Jagged Knife Shadow is a good example of a Skulk that uses hit-and-run tactics. They can divert attention by using their “Cloaked” action to become Hidden, then take advantage of their “Backstab” passive to increase their damage. However, they can only use this combo every other turn. Custom Skulk Skulks have average or higher attack modifiers and Difficulties. They usually deal moderate damage, but they can deal high damage when they attack an isolated or compromised target. Their own damage thresholds are typically in the fragile range. Make Your Own The Frostcage Peaks are treacherous at the best of times, when the sun is high and the ice pack has broken up. The warmth of the day brings out dangerous predators searching for an easy meal. Because of their command of the mountain caves and the chilling skies, Glitterwyrms have become the apex predators of this space. We’ll make them at Tier 2. • They are agile fliers, able to deftly maneuver through the frozen skies despite punishing winds. It makes sense to put their Difficulty at 14. • As ambush hunters, Glitterwyrms have evolved to secrete an oil from their scales that freezes to a mirror-like finish. While this trait helps them to surprise their prey, they are quite fragile. Damage thresholds of Major 9/Severe 18 with 5 Hit Points and 4 Stress are appropriate here. • These wyrms have keen vision, so a +2 attack modifier is appropriate. • They approach quietly and dive-bomb into their prey, hoping to push them into the icy depths and fish out the remains later. Because of this, their bite isn’t as strong as other wyrms’ might be—it only deals 2d8+3 damage. • Because they’re flying predators with sharp vision, we’ll give them a few Experiences that reflect those traits. • The secretion from their tails turns into barbs as they hibernate up on the high basalt cliffs that surround the passage. We can make an “Icicle Barb” action that allows them to use these as weapons to pin down their prey. A Skulk adversary with these traits might look like this: GLITTERWYRM Tier  Skulk A wyvern covered in mirror-like scales of ice. Motives & Tactics: Ambush, feed, hibernate, hit-and-run Difficulty: 14 | Thresholds: 9/18 | HP: 5 | Stress: 4 ATK: +2 | Bite: Very Close | 2d8+3 phy Experience: Aerial Predator +2, Keen Vision +3 FEATURES Arctic Avian - Passive: While flying, the Glitterwyrm can move up to Far range. Reflective Scales - Passive: Creatures who aren’t within Very Close range of the Glitterwyrm have disadvantage on attacks against them. Swift Claws - Action: Mark a Stress to choose a point within Far range. The Glitterwyrm moves to that point and makes an attack against a target within Very Close range. On a success, deal 2d10+5 physical damage and the target must succeed on a Strength Reaction Roll or be knocked back to Close range. Icicle Barb - Action: Spend a Fear to make an attack against a group within Close range. Targets the Glitterwyrm succeeds against take 2d4 physical damage and become Restrained by the barbs until they break free with a successful Finesse Roll. JAGGED KNIFE SHADOW Tier  Skulk A nimble scoundrel bearing a wicked knife and utilizing shadow magic to isolate targets. Motives & Tactics: Ambush, conceal, divide, profi t Difficulty: 12 | Thresholds: 4/8 | HP: 3 | Stress: 3 ATK: +1 | Daggers: Melee | 1d4+4 phy Experience: Intrusion +3 FEATURES Backstab - Passive: When the Shadow succeeds on a standard attack that has advantage, they deal 1d6+6 physical damage instead of their standard damage. Cloaked - Action: Become Hidden until after the Shadow’s next attack. Attacks made while Hidden from this feature have advantage. 203 Chapter 4: Choosing Adversaries"

When the party is faced with a Social adversary, they enter a battle of wits. Mechanics When planning a social encounter, you should pay particular attention to the motives and tactics of these adversaries. What are the characters trying to get from this encounter? Why would the adversary want to keep this information from them? What would tip the balance and force an adversary’s hand? If you have time to establish this NPC prior to their introduction into the story, let their goals and tactics guide the interaction, and give them a memorable quirk to distinguish them in the PCs’ minds. Archetypal Example A social encounter that many players have experienced is haggling with a merchant. These traders are shrewd, squeezing every coin they can out of a deal. The Merchant Social adversary uses their features to fluctuate prices and cause characters haggling poorly with them to mark Stress. Custom Socials While their physical stats might be low, Social adversaries might have other means of putting up defenses against the party. These defenses typically come in the form of passive features. The adversaries in this book are a good starting point for creating social encounters, but many times you’ll want to create your own. Make Your Own A nearby forest settlement is led by elders who have forged a great connection with nature. In gaining this power, the village leaders become an enigma to their people, hidden behind veils of shadow. We’ll make them at Tier 1. • Their hearts and wills are strong, and they wish only for the good of their people. Let’s give them a Difficulty of 14. • Because they aren’t combat-focused, we’ll give them 2 Hit Points. That means they only need a Major threshold, so let’s set that at 6. To reflect their wisdom and patience, we’ll do 4 Stress. • Many of these elders hold peace above all else and are not trained in the ways of violence. This would make their attack modifier a −2. • They might carry an old stick or a farm implement covered in vines from the bramble, but everyone knows they’re just for show. A weapon like this would deal 1d4+2 physical damage. • These elders have lived full lives, expressed by having several Experiences with larger bonuses. Their experience can show up in their passive, too—they’re world-wise and insightful, so they have advantage in these social situations. • The people of these settlements have learned to trust the will of their elders, cryptic as it can sometimes be. We’ll create an action for social encounters that mechanizes this dynamic called “No Hospitality.” They can also invoke the peace of the meadow in dire situations. This feature seems combat-oriented, but it serves a social purpose— to showcase the elders’ power, whether used against PCs or the elders’ foes. Either way, the “There Will Be Peace” reaction is a one-time-use, evocative feature that conveys their role in their village. A Social adversary with these traits might look like this: VILLAGE ELDER Tier  Social An elder of a forest village who can call upon nature magic to provide for their people. Motives & Tactics: Care for the community, judge, speak softly, uphold tradition Difficulty: 14 | Thresholds: 6/None | HP: 2 | Stress: 4 ATK: −2 | Dagger: Melee | 1d4+2 phy Experience: History +2, Nature’s Friend +3, Pillar of the Community +3 FEATURES Age Taught Me Well - Passive: All action rolls to deceive the Elder have disadvantage. No Hospitality - Action: Mark a Stress to forbid any of the Elder’s allies from selling or providing comfort to a target or their allies for the next 2d6 days. There Will Be Peace - Reaction: When a creature attacks someone within the village who the Elder can see, you can spend 2 Fear. That creature must lose all Hope, mark 2d4 Stress, and succeed on a Presence Reaction Roll (15) or fall Unconscious until 1d4 hours have passed. While Unconscious, the target can’t make action rolls, can’t speak, and automatically fails all reaction rolls. Once the Elder uses this reaction, they can never do so again. MERCHANT Tier  Social A fi nely dressed trader with a keen eye for fi nancial gain. Motives & Tactics: Buy low and sell high, create demand, inflate prices, seek profit Difficulty: 12 | Thresholds: 4/8 | HP: 3 | Stress: 3 ATK: −4 | Club: Melee | 1d4+1 phy Experience: Shrewd Negotiator +3 FEATURES Preferential Treatment - Passive: A PC who succeeds on a Presence Roll against the Merchant gains a discount on purchases. A PC who fails on a Presence Roll against the Merchant must pay more and has disadvantage on future Presence Rolls against the Merchant. The Runaround - Passive: When a PC rolls a 14 or lower on a Presence Roll made against the Merchant, they must mark a Stress. 204 Chapter 4: Choosing Adversaries"

Mechanics Some Solos have the “Relentless” feature, which allows the GM to spotlight them multiple times during a GM turn. Others have multiple reactions that work in place of the “Relentless” feature. Solo adversaries without these features should have other units with them or an environment that supports them. Because of the number of features a Solo has, they are more complex to run. Archetypal Example When looking at the range of Solo adversaries, you might happen across the Juvenile Flickerfly. Their features build on each other in a very interesting way. If the flickerfly uses their “Mind Dance” action, their “Hallucinatory Breath” reaction is even more effective. At Tier 2, their attacks deal moderate damage, but with their “Peerless Accuracy” passive, the flickerfly can hit higher-Evasion targets more often. Most importantly, they can take the spotlight up to three times during a GM turn. Custom Solos These adversaries might be bosses with loyal lieutenants or puzzling encounters the party must work around. They usually deal high damage, have tough defenses, and a large number of Hit Points. When an adversary is given the “Relentless” feature, consider how much damage they do with each attack—a creature with “Relentless (3)” should usually do less damage on a hit than a creature with “Relentless (2).” Make Your Own Deep in the ruins of the Earliest Age lies a structure buried under rubble and scorched sand. Within it is a massive forge covered in eldritch invocations. Its crucible brims with energy stolen from distant stars. Guarding this forge is an inscrutable being of twisted metal and flesh. An amalgam of writhing limbs and clicking gears, this Malefacted Giant waits for those who would claim the Starforge. We’ll make them at Tier 2. • Given their strange and unpredictable nature, 15 seems like an appropriate Difficulty. • This adversary is somewhere between humanoid and machine, giving them solid defenses. Damage thresholds of Major 16/Severe 26 with 10 HP and 5 Stress will work well for that purpose. • Because of their sheer size and strength, the giant should have a decent attack modifier at +3. • Their writhing limbs make for an interesting, evocative weapon. Let’s make it deal 2d12+4 physical damage. • Instead of having the “Relentless” feature, this adversary has the “Sweeping Dread” reaction, which allows them to make multiple attacks on a countdown that ticks down as the characters roll with Fear. As this is an aberrant, eldritch horror, we can lean into the weirdness of their being with features like “Mindbreaker” and “Behold the End.” These ramp up the oddity and let you express it in the game, bringing this adversary to life at the table. • As the giant fights, they batter the minds of their opponents. Giving them a Fear Feature that pierces through their defenses creates additional tension at the table. A Solo adversary with these traits might look like this: MALEFACTED GIANT Tier  Solo A giant humanoid made of twisted metal and melted fl esh merged together in unnatural ways. Motives & Tactics: Collect secrets, rend reality, undo fate Difficulty: 15 | Thresholds: 16/26 | HP: 10 | Stress: 5 ATK: +3 | Writhing Limbs: Close | 2d12+4 phy FEATURES Behold the End - Passive: Before a PC would make an action roll that would affect the Giant, they must make a Knowledge Reaction Roll. On a failure, the PC loses a Hope. On a success, the PC is permanently unaffected by this feature. Scream into the Void - Action: Spend a Fear to unleash a psychic scream. All targets within Close range must succeed on a Presence Reaction Roll or take 3d10 direct magic damage and mark a Stress. Mindbreaker - Action: Make a standard attack. On a success, mark a Stress to add a d8 to the damage roll. If the target marks HP from this attack, they have disadvantage on their next action roll. Sweeping Dread - Reaction: Countdown (Loop 1d). When the Giant sees a hostile target for the fi rst time, activate the countdown. It ticks down when a PC rolls with Fear. When it triggers, the Giant makes a standard attack against up to three targets within Close range. Targets the Giant succeeds against lose a Hope. Reject Reality - Reaction: When a creature within Far range of the Giant critically succeeds on an action roll, the Giant clears all Stress. JUVENILE FLICKERFLY Tier  Solo A horse-sized insect with iridescent scales and crystalline wings moving faster than the eye can see. Motives & Tactics: Collect shiny things, hunt, swoop Difficulty: 14 | Thresholds: 13/26 | HP: 10 | Stress: 5 ATK: +3 | Wing Slash: Very Close | 2d10+4 phy FEATURES Relentless (3) - Passive: The Flickerfl y can be spotlighted up to three times per GM turn. Spend Fear as usual to spotlight them. Peerless Accuracy - Passive: Before the Flickerfly makes an attack, roll a d6. On a result of 4 or higher, the target’s Evasion is halved against this attack. Mind Dance - Action: Mark a Stress to create a magically dazzling display that grapples the minds of nearby foes. All targets within Close range must make an Instinct Reaction Roll. For each target who failed, you gain a Fear and the Flickerfl y learns one of the target’s fears. Hallucinatory Breath - Reaction: Countdown (Loop 1d6). When the Flickerfl y takes damage for the fi rst time, activate the countdown. When it triggers, the Flickerfl y breathes hallucinatory gas on all targets in front of them up to Far range. Targets must succeed on an Instinct Reaction Roll or be tormented by fearful hallucinations. Targets whose fears are known to the Flickerfly have disadvantage on this roll. Targets who fail must mark a Stress and lose a Hope. 205 Chapter 4: Choosing Adversaries"

Mechanics Standard adversaries don’t offer heavy damage or amazing defenses. Instead, they fill out the ranks of a combat. They’re best utilized as a bulwark that prevents the PCs from reaching their Ranged and Support allies. They might also be a good choice for a Leader to bring into combat to replenish their forces. When creating your own adversaries, you might make Standard enemies for a faction first, then build the rest of the enemies to synergize with their abilities. Standard adversaries might be average, but they don’t need to be boring. Archetypal Example The Bladed Guard could be one of the first adversaries your party meets in a campaign. They stand at the gates, protect the townsfolk, and patrol the city’s streets. Their “Shield Wall” passive immediately tells you that more of them is always better, while their “Detain” action conveys their purpose, lining up well with their motives and tactics. Custom Standards Most everything about a Standard adversary is going to be in the average range for the tier. You can use the tables in the upcoming “Improvising Adversaries” section to choose the average for their attack modifier and the moderate damage dice for their tier. This makes them simple to create. Where Standards shine is in the features that define their role in the fiction, such as the Bladed Guard’s “Shield Wall,” the Spectral Guardian’s “Ghost,” or the Vampire’s “Draining Bite.” Make Your Own Wanderborne communities speak of a legendary troupe that pops up at a crossroad, luring travelers into a show unlike anything they’ve ever seen. Only a rare few return to tell the tale of the Empty Sky Circus. The troupe is filled with Bladedance Jesters, who constantly move to a song only they can hear. We’ll make them at Tier 4. • The jesters are quick and nimble, so to represent this, we’ll give them a Difficulty of 19. • They likely wear little armor, so we can do a low Major threshold, and a higher Severe threshold. Major 22/Severe 50 should work well. The rest of their numbers will be average; we’ll use 5 Hit Points and 3 Stress. • Bladedance Jesters are the Empty Sky Circus’s first line of defense, more focused on protection than destruction. We’ll give them a +3 attack modifier. • We’ll want a weapon that represents them—something that always needs to be in motion or move fluidly to attack. Their Chained Chakrams convey that sense of motion and grace and, as a bonus, double as a performing prop. We’ll put their attack damage at 4d8+5. • To fulfill their role as Standard adversaries, they need to be a plausible threat, which could include interfering with the characters’ movement. To do this, we can have their chakrams pull a target closer. We’ll also give the jester a reaction to dodge the brunt of some attacks as they move to an unheard dance from realms beyond. A Standard adversary with these traits might look like this: BLADEDANCE JESTER Tier  Standard A lithe circus performer attuned to a dance from realms beyond. Motives & Tactics: Channel the dance, entertain, lure away Difficulty: 19 | Thresholds: 22/50 | HP: 5 | Stress: 3 ATK: +3 | Chained Chakrams: Very Close | 4d8+5 phy Experience: Comedy +2, Dance +3 FEATURES Dance With Me - Action: Make an attack against a target within Very Close range. On a success, the target must succeed on an Agility Reaction Roll or be pulled into Melee range of the Jester, and when they next move, you gain a Fear. Silent Staccato - Reaction: When the Jester takes damage, you can mark a Stress to reduce the damage by 3d6. The Jester can then move to a point within Close range. BLADED GUARD Tier  Standard An armored guard bearing a sword and shield painted in the settlement’s colors. Motives & Tactics: Arrest, close gates, make it through the day, pin down Difficulty: 12 | Thresholds: 5/9 | HP: 5 | Stress: 2 ATK: +1 | Longsword: Melee | 1d6+1 phy Experience: Local Knowledge +3 FEATURES Shield Wall - Passive: A creature who tries to move within Very Close range of the Guard must succeed on an Agility Roll. If additional Bladed Guards are standing in a line alongside the fi rst, and each is within Melee range of another guard in the line, the Difficulty increases by the total number of guards in that line. Detain - Action: Make an attack against a target within Very Close range. On a success, mark a Stress to Restrain the target until they break free with a successful attack, Finesse Roll, or Strength Roll. 206 Chapter 4: Choosing Adversaries"

Mechanics Supports are as varied in their abilities as Leaders or Solos. They might bolster an ally or stop foes in their tracks. When selecting adversaries for an encounter, limit the use of Support adversaries—their defeat should be an important part of the tactical calculation. Protect them with Standard adversaries and distract PCs with higher-damage targets, such as a Bruiser or Ranged adversary. Archetypal Example The Cult Adept is a great example of what a Support can do. They force targets to mark Stress with their attacks, buff allies with resistance to damage, and restrain their foes. They also clear a Stress when a PC rolls a failure with Fear, which plays into their fiction very well. Custom Support Supports have similar stats to Standards, if not slightly weaker. They do low damage and have middling Hit Points. As they usually need to mark Stress to use their actions, they typically have higher Stress than other adversaries. Make Your Own Many woods are tended to by powerful practitioners of nature magic called Forest Druids. They live in hollowed roots, polished caves, or simple thatched huts. We’ll make them at Tier 1. • We’ll make them slightly easier to hit because they are a Support adversary, granting them a Difficulty of 11. • Forest Druids often wear the wood and lichen of the forests as armor. Thresholds of Major 6/Severe 10 with 4 Hit Points and 5 Stress fits their nature. • They’re likely to carry standard weapons, so we’ll give them an attack modifier of +0. • Similarly, we’ll limit their damage to mostly Minor, dealing 1d4+2. • These druids seek balance in nature, so an action that can undo the effects of a spell or condition on an ally makes sense. Additionally, the druid could leverage their understanding of the forest as a living entity, using its power to weaken their enemies. Perhaps they also summon the barbs of the wandering briar to stymie their foes. A Support adversary with these traits might look like this: FOREST DRUID Tier  Support A reclusive wanderer who understands the speech of beast and leaf. Motives & Tactics: Call upon nature, leave no trace, protect the woods at all costs Difficulty: 11 | Thresholds: 6/10 | HP: 4 | Stress: 5 ATK: +0 | Oak Staff : Melee | 1d4+2 mag Experience: Animal Knowledge +2, Lay of the Land +3 FEATURES Calm of the Vale - Action: Mark a Stress to end the effect of a spell or clear any condition affecting the Druid or an ally they can see within Very Close range. Deafening Whisper - Action: Mark a Stress to call on the winds in the canopy. A target within Close range must succeed on an Instinct Reaction Roll or the whistling wind fi lls their ears. The target is unable to hear anything besides the wind, must mark a Stress, and is Vulnerable until they clear a Stress. Overgrowth - Action: Spend a Fear and choose a point within Far range. Brambles and thorns erupt from the ground, fi lling an area within Close range of that point. A creature who enters that area or tries to move through it takes 2d6+3 physical damage and must succeed on an Agility Reaction Roll or become Restrained until they succeed on a Finesse Roll or the Druid takes Severe damage. CULT ADEPT Tier  Support An experienced mage wielding shadow and fear. Motives & Tactics: Curry favor, hinder foes, uncover knowledge Difficulty: 14 | Thresholds: 9/18 | HP: 4 | Stress: 6 ATK: +2 | Rune-Covered Rod: Far | 2d4+3 mag Experience: Fallen Lore +2, Rituals +2 FEATURES Enervating Blast - Action: Spend a Fear to make a standard attack against a target within range. On a success, the target must mark a Stress. Shroud of the Fallen - Action: Mark a Stress to wrap an ally within Close range in a shroud of Protection until the Adept marks their last HP. While Protected, the target has resistance to all damage. Shadow Shackles - Action: Spend a Fear and choose a point within Far range. All targets within Close range of that point are Restrained in smoky chains until they break free with a successful Strength or Instinct Roll. A target Restrained by this feature must spend a Hope to make an action roll. Fear Is Fuel - Reaction: Twice per scene, when a PC rolls a failure with Fear, clear a Stress. 207 Chapter 4: Choosing Adversaries"

Or you might want to replace a feature or two, then present them as an entirely different creature. When planning your session (or even mid- session), you can adjust an existing adversary’s stat block to fit the needs of your battle. When you’re mid-session and you realize you need a new adversary, don’t sweat. You can quickly adjust a stat block to a different tier by replacing its existing statistics with those listed on the Improvised Statistics by Tier table, using the column that corresponds to your party’s tier. Improvised Statistics by Tier Adversary Statistic Tier 1 Tier 2 Tier 3 Tier 4 Attack Modifier +1 +2 +3 +4 Damage Dice 1d6+2 to 1d12+4 2d6+3 to 2d12+4 3d8+3 to 3d12+5 4d8+10 to 4d12+15 Difficulty 11 14 17 20 Damage Thresholds Major 7/Severe 12 Major 10/Severe 20 Major 20/Severe 32 Major 25/Severe 45 Adjusting Between Tiers If you’re moving an adversary from Tiers 1 or 2 to Tiers 3 or 4, you’ll want to consider raising their HP and Stress by 1–3 points depending on how long you want them to last in the battle and how many Stress-based features they have. Also keep an eye out for features that deal a different amount of damage than the adversary’s standard attack, as those might need some adjustment, as well. If you feel comfortable inventing an adversary’s features on the fly, you can even improvise a completely new adversary using these statistics. Using this guidance won’t always make the adversary a perfect match for the PCs at your table, but it’ll reduce the chances of you unexpectedly overwhelming the party (or the PCs defeating your Solo adversary with just a few rolls). Adding or Changing Features When scaling an adversary to a higher tier, consider adding a new feature to make them a greater threat instead of just scaling up the damage and Difficulty of their existing features. Similarly, if scaling down to a lower tier, consider removing one of the adversary’s most powerful or impactful features. Improvising Hordes, Minions, and Solos If you’re improvising a Horde, Minion, or Solo adversary, keep in mind that their power levels are very different from other adversaries’. The following guidance can help you create these adversaries on the fly: Horde: Their standard attack should deal high damage, then reduce (roughly by half) when the Horde has marked half or more of their HP. Minion: Give them a flat damage value for their standard attack, usually between 1 and 5, and use that value for their “Group Attack” feature. You’ll also set the value of their “Minion” feature, determining how much damage is needed to defeat additional Minions in one attack. This is usually between 3 and 15, depending on the adversary’s tier. Solo: Give them high damage, high HP, and features that let them act more frequently (like “Relentless”) or deal area-of-effect damage. DEFEATED ADVERSARIES When an adversary marks their last Hit Point, they are defeated (unless they have a feature that gives them a second chance!), but you and your players decide what this means. For example, the PCs might knock the adversary unconscious, tie them up, or kill them. Important adversaries might have means of cheating or faking death, slipping through the cracks to reappear later in the campaign. 208 Chapter 4: Choosing Adversaries"

VOLCANIC DRAGON:: ashen tyrant 239 Chapter 4: Tier 4 Adversaries\n-- 240 of 415 --\nUsing Environments Environments represent everything in a scene beyond the PCs and adversaries, such as the physical space, background NPCs, and natural forces. Much like adversaries, each listed environment has a stat block that provides tools for affecting the PCs and the wider scene. These stat blocks aren’t restricted to combat—you can use environment stat blocks to enhance any scene, from the intrigue of a festive gala to the danger of crumbling ruins. Environments and adversaries are built to interact with and support one another, both mechanically and narratively. While the PCs and adversaries take focus, environments can represent hazards that originate from the world itself or the background characters who don’t need entire stat blocks. This section describes how to use each environment’s stat block, and the upcoming “Environment Stat Blocks” section presents examples of environments, grouped by tier to represent their general threat level. The environment framework is meant to be inspiring and practical, rather than unchangeable and prescriptive. It provides a way to organize and prepare ideas for important scenes. You can customize the environments to fit your game’s characters and events—for example, you could change the Imperial Court environment into a Queen’s Birthday Feast environment, or create a stat block for a Rebel Uprising based on the Pitched Battle environment features. And if you don’t want to use this adversary-like system for environments, you can ignore these stat blocks entirely—Daggerheart is just as enjoyable without them. ENVIRONMENT BREAKDOWN Each environment’s stat block presents the statistics you need to utilize them in play. The following example illustrates this format. Each stat block contains the following elements: Name Each environment stat block has a unique name—in this case, a Raging River. Tier Each environment is designed to challenge PCs of a certain tier. If you use environment stat blocks from other tiers, you might want to adjust their statistics, such as their Difficulty and adversaries. Type The environment’s type appears alongside its tier, representing the type of scene it most easily supports. The Raging River is a Traversal environment, meaning that the threats and obstacles the PCs encounter there will most likely be physical in nature. Description An evocative one-line summary of the environment. Impulses Each environment has “impulses,” or the narrative way they push and pull on those within them. Places don’t have volition, but the people and forces that comprise an environment gravitate toward certain goals and actions (such as a river rushing to carry you away or drown you, or a casino disorienting and pushing people to gamble away their money). Difficulty Raging River has a Difficulty of 10, which provides a baseline for action rolls made to directly oppose the elements of this environment. Individual adversaries appearing in the environment may have their own Difficulty. Potential Adversaries Many environments suggest specific adversaries that commonly appear in scenes with that environment. Not every listed adversary needs to appear in an environment, and you’re free to use others instead. Features Features provide inspiration for GM moves you can use that represent the dynamic landscape or situation. RAGING RIVER Tier  Traversal A swift-moving river without a bridge crossing, deep enough to sweep away most people. Impulses: Bar crossing, carry away the unready, divide the land Difficulty: 10 Potential Adversaries: Beasts (Bear, Glass Snake), Jagged Knife Bandits (Hexer, Kneebreaker, Lackey, Lieutenant, Shadow, Sniper) FEATURES Dangerous Crossing - Passive: Crossing the river requires the party to complete a Progress Countdown (4). A PC who rolls a failure with Fear is immediately targeted by the “Undertow” action without requiring a Fear to be spent on the feature. Have any of the PCs forded rivers like this before? Are any of them afraid of drowning? Undertow - Action: Spend a Fear to catch a PC in the undertow. They must make an Agility Reaction Roll. On a failure, they take 1d6+1 physical damage and are moved a Close distance down the river, becoming Vulnerable until they get out of the river. On a success, they must mark a Stress. What trinkets and baubles lie along the bottom of the riverbed? Do predators swim these rivers? Patient Hunter - Action: Spend a Fear to summon a Glass Snake within Close range of a chosen PC. The Snake appears in or near the river and immediately takes the spotlight to use their “Spinning Serpent” action. What treasures does the beast have in their burrow? What travelers have already fallen victim to this predator? 240 Chapter 4: Using Environments"

Exciting encounters in unexpected environments can provide contrast or round out the narrative. Don’t be afraid to plan a social encounter in a dangerous Traversal environment, or a duel to the death in a Social environment. Environment types include the following: • Explorations are wondrous locations with mysteries and marvels to discover. • Socials are locations that primarily present interpersonal challenges. • Traversals are dangerous locations where moving around the space itself is a challenge. • Events are defined more by the activity taking place than the space they take place in. ENVIRONMENT FEATURES The bottom of each stat block lists that environment’s features. Feature Questions Below each feature, you’ll find italicized questions. These questions are there to inspire plot hooks, provide ideas to fuel the scene, and help connect the scene to other story elements. For example, the Raging River’s “Undertow” feature asks, “What trinkets and baubles lie along the bottom of the riverbed? Do predators swim these rivers?” These questions invite you to consider who or what has been here before, what their presence has left behind, as well as what predators might take advantage of the powerful undertow for their own benefit. Using Features When you make a GM move, you can use environment features like you would adversary features. Environment features can take the form of actions (which can be used as your GM move), reactions (which happen freely in response to a trigger), and passives (which automatically apply). Fear Features Like adversaries, environments can have Fear Features— powerful, scene-defining effects that require spending Fear to activate. Most environment Fear Features take the form of actions, such as the following example: Tunneling Terror - Action Spend a Fear to summon an Acid Burrower, who bursts up from the ground where they have been waiting for prey. The Acid Burrower takes the spotlight to use their “Earth Eruption” action. Not every environment has a Fear Feature—we recommend reserving them for when they’re most impactful. 241 Chapter 4: Using Environments"

Or you might want to replace a feature or two, then present it as an entirely different environment. Whether planning your session or even improvising an environment mid-session, you can adjust an existing environment’s stat block to fit the needs of your scene or improvise elements as needed. The environments framework is there to help organize ideas, not to stifle creativity. When you need to quickly adjust a stat block to a different tier, you can simply replace its existing statistics with those listed on the Environment Statistics by Tier table, using the column that corresponds to your party’s tier. Environment Statistics by Tier Environment Statistic Tier 1 Tier 2 Tier 3 Tier 4 Damage Dice 1d6+1 to 1d8+3 2d6+3 to 2d10+2 3d8+3 to 3d10+1 4d8+3 to 4d10+10 Difficulty 11 14 17 20 Scaling Environments Environments are easier to scale than adversaries, since they don’t have Hit Points, damage thresholds, or Stress. You’ll want to adjust the default Difficulty, any Difficulties listed in features, and the damage dealt by features. If the environment has a feature that involves summoning an adversary, consider replacing the listed adversaries with ones appropriate to the party’s tier or or scaling down the listed adversaries. Adding or Changing Features When scaling an environment to a higher tier, consider adding a Fear Feature if there isn’t one already. Similarly, if scaling down to a lower tier, consider removing the most powerful or impactful feature.

CASTLE SIEGE PITCHED BATTLE 249 Chapter 4: Enviroment Stat Blocks\n-- 250 of 415 --\nTIER 4 ENVIRONMENTS (LEVELS 8–10) CHAOS REALM Tier  Traversal An otherworldly space where the laws of reality are unstable and dangerous. Impulses: Annihilate certainty, consume power, defy logic Difficulty: 20 Potential Adversaries: Outer Realms Monstrosities (Abomination, Corruptor, Thrall) FEATURES Impossible Architecture - Passive: Up is down, down is right, right is starward. Gravity and directionality themselves are in fl ux, and any attempt to move through this realm is an odyssey unto itself, requiring a Progress Countdown (8). On a failure, a PC must mark a Stress in addition to the roll’s other consequences. What does it feel like to move in a space so alien to the Mortal Realm? What landmark or point do you fi xate on to maintain your balance? What bizarre landmarks do you traverse on your journey? Everything You Are This Place Will Take from You - Action: Countdown (Loop 1d). Activate the countdown. When it triggers, all PCs must succeed on a Presence Reaction Roll or their highest trait is temporarily reduced by 1d4 unless they mark a number of Stress equal to its value. Any lost trait points are regained if the PC critically succeeds or escapes the Chaos Realm. How does this place try to steal from you that which makes you legendary? What does it feel to have this power taken from you? Unmaking - Action: Spend a Fear to force a PC to make a Strength Reaction Roll. On a failure, they take 4d10 direct magic damage. On a success, they must mark a Stress. What glimpse of other worlds do you catch while this place tries to unmake you? What core facet of your personality does the unmaking try to erase? Outer Realms Predators - Action: Spend a Fear to summon an Outer Realms Abomination, an Outer Realms Corruptor, and 2d6 Outer Realms Thralls, who appear at Close range of a chosen PC in defiance of logic and causality. Immediately spotlight one of these adversaries, and you can spend an additional Fear to automatically succeed on that adversary’s standard attack. What half-consumed remnants of the shattered world do these monstrosities cast aside in pursuit of living fl esh? What jagged refl ections of former personhood do you catch between moments of unquestioning malice? Disorienting Reality - Reaction: On a result with Fear, you can ask the PC to describe which of their fears the Chaos Realm evokes as a vision of reality unmakes and reconstitutes itself to the PC. The PC loses a Hope. If it is their last Hope, you gain a Fear. What moment do they see? If it’s a memory, how is it warped by this place? How hard will it be to hold on to the real memory? DIVINE USURPATION Tier  Event A massive ritual designed to breach the gates of the Hallows Above and unseat the New Gods themselves. Impulses: Collect power, overawe, silence dissent Difficulty: 20 Potential Adversaries: Arch-Necromancer, Fallen Shock Troops, Mortal Hunter, Oracle of Doom, Perfected Zombie FEATURES Final Preparations - Passive: When the environment fi rst takes the spotlight, designate one adversary as the Usurper seeking to overthrow the gods. Activate a Long-Term Countdown (8) as the Usurper assembles what they need to conduct the ritual. When it triggers, spotlight this environment to use the “Beginning of the End” feature. While this environment remains in play, you can hold up to 15 Fear. What does the Usurper still require: The heart of a High Seraph? The lodestone of an ancient waygate? The loyalty of two archenemies? The heartbroken tears of a pure soul? Divine Blessing - Passive: When a PC critically succeeds, they can spend 2 Hope to refresh an ability normally limited by uses (such as once per rest, once per session). What god favors you as you fi ght against this usurpation? How does your renewed power reflect their infl uence? Defi lers Abound - Action: Spend 2 Fear to summon 1d4+2 Fallen Shock Troops that appear within Close range of the Usurper to assist their divine siege. Immediately spotlight the Shock Troops to use a “Group Attack” action. Which High Fallen do these troops serve? Which god’s flesh do they wish to feast upon? Godslayer - Action: If the Divine Siege Countdown (see “Beginning of the End”) has triggered, you can spend 3 Fear to describe the Usurper slaying one of the gods of the Hallows Above, feasting upon their power and growing stronger. The Usurper clears 2 HP. Increase their Difficulty, damage, attack modifier, or give them a new feature from the slain god. Which god meets their end? What are their last words? How does the Usurper’s new stolen power manifest? Beginning of the End - Reaction: When the “Final Preparations” long-term countdown triggers, the Usurper begins hammering on the gates of the Hallows themselves. Activate a Divine Siege Countdown (10). Spotlight the Usurper to describe the Usurper’s assault and tick down this countdown by 1. If the Usurper takes Major or greater damage, tick up the countdown by 1. When it triggers, the Usurper shatters the barrier between the Mortal Realm and the Hallows Above to slay the gods and take their place. You gain a Fear for each unmarked HP the Usurper has. You can immediately use the “Godslayer” feature without spending Fear to make an additional GM move. How does the Mortal Realm writhe as the natural order is violated? What mortals witness this blasphemy from afar? Ritual Nexus - Reaction: On any failure with Fear against the Usurper, the PC must mark 1d4 Stress from the backlash of magical power. What visions of failures past torment you as your efforts fall short? How are these memories twisted by the Usurper? CHAOS REALM 250 Chapter 4: Enviroment Stat Blocks"

Impulses: Justify and perpetuate imperial rule, seduce rivals with promises of power and comfort Difficulty: 20 Potential Adversaries: Bladed Guard, Courtesan, Knight of the Realm, Monarch, Spy FEATURES All Roads Lead Here - Passive: While in the Imperial Court, a PC has disadvantage on Presence Rolls made to take actions that don’t fit the imperial way of life or support the empire’s dominance. How does the way language is used make even discussing alternative ways of living difficult? What obvious benefi ts for loyalty create friction when you try to discuss alternatives? Rival Vassals - Passive: The PCs can find imperial subjects, vassals, and supplicants in the court, each vying for favor, seeking proximity to power, exchanging favors for loyalty, and elevating their status above others’. Some might be desperate to undermine their rivals, while others might even be open to discussions that verge on sedition. How do they benefit from vassalage, and what has it cost them? What exploitation drives them to consider opposing the unstoppable? The Gravity of Empire - Action: Spend a Fear to present a PC with a golden opportunity or offer to satisfy a major goal in exchange for obeying or supporting the empire. The target must make a Presence Reaction Roll. On a failure, they must mark all their Stress or accept the offer. If they have already marked all their Stress, they must accept the offer or exile themselves from the empire. On a success, they must mark 1d4 Stress as they’re taxed by temptation. What do the PCs want so desperately they might consider throwing in with this ruthless power? How did imperial agents learn the PC’s greatest desires? Imperial Decree - Action: Spend a Fear to tick down a long-term countdown related to the empire’s agenda by 1d4. If this triggers the countdown, a proclamation related to the agenda is announced at court as the plan is executed. What display of power or transfer of wealth was needed to expedite this plan? Whose lives were disrupted or upended to make this happen? Eyes Everywhere - Reaction: On a result with Fear, you can spend a Fear to have someone loyal to the empire overhear seditious talk within the court. A PC must succeed on an Instinct Reaction Roll to notice that the group has been overheard so they can try to intercept the witness before the PCs are exposed. How has the empire compromised this witness? Why is their fi rst impulse to protect the empire, even if doesn’t treat them well? NECROMANCER’S OSSUARY Tier  Exploration A dusty crypt with a library, twisting corridors, and abundant sarcophagi, spattered with the blood of ill-fated invaders. Impulses: Confound intruders, delve into secrets best left buried, manifest unlife, unleash a tide of undead Difficulty: 19 Potential Adversaries: Arch-Necromancer’s Host (Perfected Zombie, Zombie Legion) FEATURES No Place for the Living - Passive: A feature or action that clears HP requires spending a Hope to use. If it already costs Hope, a PC must spend an additional Hope. What does it feel like to try to heal in a place so antithetical to life? Centuries of Knowledge - Passive: A PC can investigate the library and laboratory and make a Knowledge Roll to learn information related to arcana, local history, and the Necromancer’s plans. What are the names of the tomes? What project is the necromancer working on and what does it communicate about their plans? Skeletal Burst - Action: All targets within Close range of a point you choose in this environment must succeed on an Agility Reaction Roll or take 4d8+8 physical damage from skeletal shrapnel as part of the ossuary detonates around them. What ancient skeletal architecture is destroyed? What bones stick in your armor? Aura of Death - Action: Once per scene, roll a d4. Each undead within Far range of the Necromancer can clear HP and Stress equal to the result rolled. The undead can choose how that number is divided between HP and Stress. How does their renewed vigor manifest? Do they look more lifelike or, paradoxically, are they more decayed but vigorous? They Just Keep Coming! - Action: Spend a Fear to summon 1d6 Rotted Zombies, two Perfected Zombies, or a Zombie Legion, who appear at Close range of a chosen PC. Who were these people before they became the necromancer’s pawns? What vestiges of those lives remain for the heroes to see? NECROMANCER'S OSSUARY 251 Chapter 4: Enviroment Stat Blocks"

These frames provide inspiration, tools, and mechanics to support the story your table will tell. You can choose one of the campaign frames from the following pages or use their structure to inspire your own. Every campaign frame has a complexity rating that indicates how challenging the campaign is to run. Campaign frames with a lower complexity rating often sit squarely within the kind of genre Daggerheart is built for and don’t have many additional mechanics to consider. Campaign frames with a higher complexity rating often push the genre of the campaign outside the bounds of traditional fantasy, contain more in-depth mechanics to implement, and require a GM who is comfortable creating new game elements (often known as “homebrewing”)—such as stat blocks, equipment, and similar content—for their players. Each campaign frame includes the following sections. • A pitch to present to players • Suggestions for the campaign’s tone, feel, themes, and cultural touchstones that helped shaped it • An overview of the campaign’s background • Guidance for how certain communities, ancestries, and classes fit into the setting • Principles for players and GMs to consider during the campaign • Unique setting distinctions • An inciting incident to launch the campaign • Special mechanics to use during the campaign • Questions to consider during session zero You can find each campaign frame map in the appendix or at www.daggerheart.com/downloads. Campaign Frame Breakdown The following steps highlight the important parts of a campaign frame and describe how to use a frame to start a new campaign. STEP 1: PITCH THE CAMPAIGN Use the pitch to give your players a brief idea of what the campaign will be like. You can also pull from the touchstones section (eliminating or adding your own as you’d like) and share the tone & feel and themes. Answer any question they might have and ensure they are interested in the campaign. STEP 2: PROVIDE THE FOUNDATIONS Once the players are onboard, give them the overview and player principles. You may also choose to read them your GM principles. Additionally, provide them any information from distinctions you think might be relevant, as well as any campaign mechanics they should know. STEP 3: GUIDE THEIR CHARACTERS As they are brainstorming what kind of characters they want to make, you can share the information from the communities, ancestries, and class sections as applicable. These can be overwhelming to engage with all at once, so as they become relevant, discuss as needed with your players. STEP 4: BUILD THE MAP Once players have made their characters, pass a copy of the campaign frame map around the table, adding locations to it collectively from either the available list or your imaginations. Follow the rest of the Session Zero prep as usual. STEP 5: RUN A SESSION ZERO Choose any of the session zero questions from the campaign frame to ask your players. STEP 6: BEGIN THE ADVENTURE Finally, use the provided inciting incident—or write your own—to start the campaign! Each campaign frame in the following section is written by a unique team of writers and is specialized to the needs of the campaign it facilitates. Because of this, their style, voice, complexity, and approach vary more than other sections of this book. Use these frames as inspiration when developing your own campaign. We don’t want you to be hemmed in by a strict template, so expand upon the pieces that work for your table and let the rest fall away. 253 Chapter 5: Campaign Frames"

Designed by Carlos Cisco, Rowan Hall, & Spenser Starke Complexity Rating: • THE PITCH Read this section to your players to introduce them to the campaign. Fanewick was once a place of great abundance and peace— dangerous to those unfamiliar with the land, but a cornucopia to those who respected its ways. When Haven invaded the wilds and forced the land into eternal spring, a dangerous bloom known as the Witherwild took hold and now threatens the lives of all who live there. In a Witherwild campaign, you’ll play unlikely heroes from humble beginnings who are reckoning with their newfound duty to save Fanewick’s people from dangerous corruption.

Fanewick is a wild and untamed land, long avoided by outside forces. The woods are dark and twisting, filled with Faint Divinities who perform small miracles and services for its inhabitants, but are just as likely to lure travelers off narrow paths to their ruin. Seemingly harmless expanses of field hide bogs that engulf entire armies, consuming heavy artillery as quickly as it can cross the border. This wilderness fosters hardy people who are bold enough to raise families where others have not and strictly follow the unique rules that keep them safe. These Wicklings remained insulated from their neighbors’ wars until plague forced the people of Haven to desperate acts. Haven was once the most powerful force in the region; for centuries, the high stone walls into the capital bore the phrase “The Godless Gate.” While the original meaning has been lost to common knowledge, some dusty tomes and ancient records state that the founders of Haven wished to be free of the influence of the Faint Divinities that dominated the surrounding regions. They hatched a plan to kill one of the mightiest of these deities, known as Shun’Aush the Granite Ophid. While their exact method of deicide is forgotten, their victory ensured Haven’s dominance in the region for centuries to come. They made their home behind his remains, which became the mighty walls that Haven is known for. But Shun’Aush would have his revenge. As the Havenites carved through his stone body, the fine dust left behind settled into the surrounding earth. There was a time of prosperity over many centuries while the scales of the god remained undisturbed. But progress is its own pressure. The growing population demanded increased productivity, and as farmers tilled deeper soil and miners hacked into hidden stone, the ancient stone dust rose to the surface. The same walls that brought the city security became the crucible that incubated a virulent plague. Over the last two years, over half of Haven’s populace fell to a disease known as the Serpent’s Sickness. First, victims cough up dust. Soon after, their skin breaks out in a scaling rash. Finally, their body hardens—first the flesh, bones, and soft tissue, spreading until, finally, their organs ossify. Once within the organs, “the serpent” moves so quickly that sufferers petrify where they stand, filling Haven with statues of victims in their last moments of agony. The High Magus of Haven, Archmage Phylax, discovered a rare red flower called the crimson lady’s veil that could cure the Serpent’s Sickness. These buds grow prolifically across Fanewick in the spring—but for every ten thousand of the common white-petaled blossoms, only one red flower blooms. Desperate to save their people from the plague, Haven invaded Fanewick to amass the scarce red buds. Their forces plunged into the deep wood and, under the guidance of Archmage Phylax, plucked out the Reaping Eye from the most powerful Faint Divinity that protected the land: The Great Owl Nikta, the Shepherd of the Seasons. The Shepherd kept Fanewick in balance by turning her eyes upon the land, first for ripening, then ruination. Thus Nikta maintained the cycle of seasons—of growth and decay, of death and rebirth. With her Reaping Eye removed, Nikta can only watch over Fanewick with the Sowing Eye, forcing the land into everlasting spring. In the year since, Haven has conquered the bogs, turning them into fields to harvest red flowers. The endless growth that once seemed like a gift quickly evolved into a scourge known as the Witherwild—Fanewick’s flora and fauna flourished, unchecked and uncontrolled. Animals swell to massive size; trees warp, twist, and begin to hunt people; and vines creep along the forest floor, strangling all they touch. This explosive growth is unconquerable and unrelenting, with no force able to stop the burgeoning verdance for long. Prior to the Serpent’s Sickness and the Shepherd’s endless growth, your party lived a peaceful life in Fanewick or a life of toil and conquest in Haven. But when the danger demands a response, even the unprepared—and unwilling—must make a stand. THE WITHERWILD 255 Chapter 5: The Witherwild"

THE WITHERWILD 255 Chapter 5: The Witherwild\n-- 256 of 415 --\nCOMMUNITIES All communities are available, but some have unique aspects within a Witherwild campaign. As needed, provide the following information to your players and choose one or more of the questions to ask them during your session zero. Loreborne and Highborne In Fanewick, knowledge is the most valuable commodity, and those who have expertise have the most power. This economy of information functions primarily through gifting and trading, and wisdom would be considered acceptable collateral for a weapon or warm meal. As such, loreborne community members are the wealthiest in Fanewick and might be smaller, distinct groups of hunters, historians, or artisans within larger villages. • What knowledge did your community teach you that you must now protect or share? • What are you able to accomplish because of your upbringing that others outside your community do not understand? • You once traded important knowledge for something terrible. What did you impart and what did you gain in return? In Haven, the wealthiest members are highborne, having inherited riches built in the walled city over generations. While the highborne of Haven were more insulated from the Serpent’s Sickness, none were immune. • Who have you lost to the Serpent’s Sickness? How did it affect you? • How did your family make their wealth? Have you rejected or embraced their core set of ethics? • You grew up in a world of abundance but were kept from learning something about the world. What was this knowledge and when did you discover it? Ridgeborne, Underborne, and Wildborne Characters from these communities were likely raised in Fanewick’s deadly environs, which have only become more dangerous as the Witherwild grows. Each community has unique customs, some freely shared and others kept secret, that allow them safe passage through dangerous terrain and the Faint Divinities’ territories. In exchange for protection from the Witherwild for themselves and their families, some Wicklings from these groups have been forced to take jobs as farmers in Haven’s flower fields. Though it is backbreaking work performed for a nation destroying their land, the farmers are offered safety by the Haven fires that burn back the ever-creeping Witherwild. • What Faint Divinities do you give tribute to, and how have you been rewarded in kind? • You displeased a god of Fanewick. What did you do, and what misfortune befell you or a loved one? • You fled the place of your birth. What circumstances drove you to leave? Orderborne Players might choose to build orderborne characters if they want to play current or former members of the Haven Army that invaded Fanewick. Though the army brings violence into this land, they also carry overwhelming grief for a homeland succumbing to disease. • What regrets do you carry with you from your conquest of foreign soil? • What kindness did an enemy combatant bestow upon you in an hour of need? How did this change your view of the people of Fanewick? • You were charged with planting a rumor in a Fanewick community. What is the rumor, and do you plan to carry out this mission? Slyborne As the Haven Army is the current martial power in Fanewick, those who wish to play slyborne characters might come from Fanewick rebel groups seeking to expel the invading forces from their lands. Depending on the tactics their group employs, a character from a slyborne community might align with or go against their upbringing. • Who among the Haven Army do you wish to exact revenge upon and why? • You joined an insurgent group working to free this land from Haven’s grasp. What has given you doubts about the leadership’s methods? • Someone you love is a member of the Haven Army. How have you used your position in the rebellion to protect them?

THE WITHERWILD 256 Chapter 5: The Witherwild\n-- 257 of 415 --\nSeaborne Both Fanewick and Haven have a coastal border. The majority of Fanewick’s seaborne communities live in small seaside groups and focus on local travel to neighboring regions, while Havenites tend to live in large ports that ship and receive goods from distant lands. • You recently traveled by sea over a vast distance. What went terribly wrong on that passage, and how has it changed you? • Growing up on the sea taught you a skill few have. What did you learn, and how did it save your life? • You used to sail with a companion. Who were they, and how do you remain connected? Wanderborne Wanderborne communities can be found in both Fanewick and Haven, though safe travel has been severely restricted due to the military occupation and the expansion of the Witherwild. Whether a wanderborne character comes from Fanewick, Haven, or elsewhere, the player should determine their character’s personal views on the invasion of Fanewick, and how that aligns or departs from their community’s views. • What do you do to keep your small community safe, independent, and hidden from Haven’s forces? • Because of your community’s transience, you have loved ones in both Fanewick and Haven. How has this affected your relationship with the invasion? • Your community travels to protect something. What is it, and why does it keep you from settling down? ANCESTRIES All ancestries are available, but some have unique aspects within a Witherwild campaign. As needed, provide the following information to your players. Clanks Clanks from Haven are commonly made from iron and steel, while clanks from Fanewick are typically constructed from wood and stone. Fungril Since the Witherwild spread throughout Fanewick, some fungril inhabiting the forests have grown noticeably larger than fungril from other regions. Drakona, Fauns, Firbolgs, and Infernis After the Witherwild corrupted Fanewick, some drakona, fauns, firbolgs, and infernis have noticed their horns growing faster and longer. Galapa and Ribbets Many families of galapa and ribbets who lived in the bogs of Fanewick were displaced when Haven’s army invaded. Havenites and the Serpent’s Sickness Anyone, but especially those from Haven, may carry the Serpent’s Sickness, which stiffens their movements and gives them limited time to survive without a cure. CLASSES All classes are available, but some have unique aspects within a Witherwild campaign. As needed, provide the following information to your players. Druids, Rangers, and Sorcerers Druids, rangers, and sorcerers are commonly found throughout Fanewick. If players choose one of these classes, they should consider how their character’s connection to the natural world might be impacted by the Witherwild. Warriors and Wizards Warriors and wizards are prevalent in Haven. A large wizarding school in Haven teaches fighters and healers, and the Haven Army is largely composed of warriors and School of War wizards. If a PC is either of these classes, consider their personal relationship to the Haven Army. Vengeance Guardian Many Wicklings who seek revenge on Haven or to expel them from Fanewick become Vengeance guardians. If players choose this subclass, they should consider what ideals or institutions their character protects. Syndicate Rogue The Haven Army sends spies into Fanewick communities to gain information on planned attacks and manipulate public perception. When selecting the Syndicate rogue subclass, players should consider how their character might be connected to or impacted by these covert operatives. THE WITHERWILD 257 Chapter 5: The Witherwild"

THE WITHERWILD 257 Chapter 5: The Witherwild\n-- 258 of 415 --\nPLAYER PRINCIPLES If your group decides to play this campaign, give your players the following information before character creation. Make the Invasion Personal Consider how Haven’s invasion of Fanewick deeply impacts your character. Let these details inform what they want and what they’re willing to do to get it. Everyone has lost a loved one to the Witherwild or the Serpent’s Sickness, and more are dying by the day. Consider how the growing conflict caused your character to act in ways they aren’t proud of, or transformed personal truths they once believed were unshakable. Treat Death with Importance Taking a life should not be done without consideration, desperation, and consequences. As your character journeys, they should remember those they’ve lost and those they’ve slain, allowing each death to affect their choices in the future. Embrace Vulnerability Find your character’s humanity and showcase it whenever you can. They should be as vulnerable during quiet moments as they are vicious during violent ones, opening up to their allies even if they close themself off to everyone else. GM PRINCIPLES Keep the following guidance in mind while you GM this campaign. Paint the World in Contrast Subvert expectations by giving space for the nightmarish to charm and the beautiful to terrify. Give the PCs visions of the natural beauty of Fanewick that has run roughshod across the region, breaking the bounds of the bogs and forests and devastating homes and communities. Show the grim and ordered life behind Haven’s walls, but also show the culture, art, and progress that has come out of centuries of safety. Contrast the capricious nature of the Faint Divinities with the devotion of the Wicklings and Havenites fighting to save their home. In a place of long nights and days, dual seasons, and two nations in conflict, look for ways to highlight bold dualities. Show Them True Danger Though it may be tragic, bodily harm is not the worst tragedy that can befall the characters. To illustrate what’s truly at stake, use the PCs’ origins in Fanewick or Haven to show them what they stand to lose, be it their homes, family, friends, communities, or even their core truths and beliefs. The events of this campaign may change, threaten, or destroy these aspects of their past—when your players create and are invested in their character’s backstory, they have something to fight for. Offer Alternatives to Violence By illuminating nonviolent approaches to problem-solving, the PCs can help break the brutal cycle that binds this world. For example, showing compassion—rather than swordpoint— to a corrupted beast can free them from the Witherwild. Similarly, the conflict between Haven and Fanewick shouldn’t only be solved with blood and blade. What threatens both could also unify them. Give the PCs opportunities to mend old wounds, right past wrongs, and heal the rift between Haven and Fanewick from within. Create Multidimensional Allies and Adversaries No adversary or ally is all good or all bad, and they each have multidimensional lives. Even the most congenial ally should be hiding darkness inside them, hoping their failings will go undiscovered. Those painted as evil should sometimes do the right thing, even if it’s for the wrong reason. Just because a PC or NPC is from Haven doesn’t make them a villain, and, conversely, not all the inhabitants of Fanewick are virtuous. Finding the nuance, complications, and deeper motivations of the people of Haven and Fanewick will lead to richer interactions, more complex moral choices, and a deeper sense of attachment to the world for the players.

The Weeks of Day and Night The day and night cycle occurs weekly, meaning the sun rises for an entire week before setting into a nighttime of the same length. This has an impact on everything from agriculture to trade, as many merchants refuse to travel through the night. But this cycle doesn’t just affect Wicklings, it’s dictated how Fanewick’s wondrous ecology has evolved. Days and nights are accompanied by entirely different natural soundscapes as Fanewick’s nocturnal denizens sleep through the long days and stalk the woods in times of darkness while their diurnal counterparts sleep. The plants similarly live on this strange day-night loop, and many live out their entire life cycles in a week. Sun rose vines make a thorny ascent to the top of the tree canopy over the course of the week, only to wilt under the light of the moon. Conversely, night bloom, a bioluminescent flower that emits the smell of burnt sugar and decay, only blossoms when evening falls, illuminating patches of forest—a godsend to anyone forced to travel in the dark. The Serpent’s Sickness The plague sweeping across Haven spares no one. Since the initial outbreak, Haven officials have worked tirelessly to quarantine those in the early stages of the disease, but this effort has done little to stop its spread. Due to the rarity of crimson lady’s veil, many citizens began to carry or consume all manner of flowers and snake sheddings in an attempt to protect or cure themselves. In the initial stages, victims are afflicted with a hacking cough laden with dust that resembles powdered bone. Then a scaled rash erupts across their skin, cracking their flesh in a unique and painful pattern that resembles a snake’s skin. Not long after, the victims’ bodies harden until their organs solidify and cease to function. The final stages of the Serpent’s Sickness is so quick that many transform into statues where they stand, leaving all of Haven a cenotaph to a once-great power. Lady’s Veil These small flowers grow in patches of sun throughout Fanewick. For every ten thousand blossoms of white-petaled flowers, one blooms a unique and vibrant red. These flowers have long been used in herbal teas across the region, with the crimson flowers holding a place in specific ceremonies. Even so, they were only foraged until the Havenites discovered crimson lady’s veil—the only known cure for Serpent’s Sickness. Thus, the Haven Army invaded Fanewick and began cultivating the flowers on massive farms that have overtaken the region’s bogs. Though the theft of the Reaping Eye has created an indefinite growing season, the red flowers remain just as rare, and Fanewick is permeated by a sickly sweet smell as the Haven Army races to mass-produce a cure for the Serpent’s Sickness.

THE WITHERWILD 259 Chapter 5: The Witherwild\n-- 260 of 415 --\nThe Witherwild This corruption, empowered by the endless spring, is spreading throughout Fanewick. Some believe the overgrowth began in the forest, while others claim it sprang from the bogs. But no matter its origins, this flourishing malignancy induces horrific changes and massive growth on anything it touches, transforming them into Withered beings. Plants spring to life with a desire to consume all around them. Animals grow to immense proportions, with onerous dispositions to match their exaggerated teeth, tusks, and claws. Even harmless creatures that were once hunted for food have become dangerous and formidable adversaries. When a person is corrupted by the Witherwild, either from a purposeful attack or accidental harm (see the upcoming “Corruption from the Witherwild” section), they are transformed. They become a nightmarish hybrid—their body warped and intertwined with plant or beast. The Witherwild slowly replaces the personality of its victims with the same drive to consume exhibited by the rest of the corrupted Fanewick. Though the Withered may retain a semblance of who they are for a time, they eventually face the final loss of their personhood. Some Wicklings believe the Withered are gifted this power by Nikta’s wrath to drive the forces of Haven from Fanewick and return the Shepherd’s Reaping Eye. The Gods of Fanewick Gods in this land aren’t ethereal concepts that exist in another realm; instead, they wander the land as incarnate beings, residing in both the natural world as well as within homes and small villages. As such, they’re generally present in Wicklings’ lives. Many communities, and some larger families, even have their own small god or tutelary spirit who watches over them. Belief and worship take on a different meaning in Fanewick— there is a constant push and pull between the goals of people and their deific neighbors. The gods must curry worship from mortals, often by performing small miracles, acts of service, or by testing their resolve with tricks and curses. Mortals rely on the small blessings from the gods to keep them safe when traveling and working in Fanewick. The most powerful and widely acknowledged Faint Divinity is the Shepherd of Seasons, Nikta, as the loss of her eye had the most recent and visible impact on everyone in Fanewick. Fanewick’s various divinities each have their own opinion concerning the Witherwild corruption. While some enjoy nature’s newfound dominance, many of the lesser deities are wary of how out of balance Fanewick has become. While their behavior and motives may be inscrutable, these deities are more accessible than gods who watch from on high. Fulg, Stacker of Stones: A small god who favors tribute in the form of smooth, stacked river rocks. Under his power, bivalves and limpets grow abundantly on rocks where they can be easily harvested. He is largely uninformed about the problems Fanewick faces, and he prefers it that way. Hyacynis, They Who Spread Small Blossoms: A friend of bees and tiny flowers who has embraced the Witherwild after seeing their influence and domain swell (literally) to immense proportions. They’re enjoying this rampant growth and do not see a reason to end it. Ikla, the Sky Painter: Ikla’s artistic prowess and talent are unmatched, painting the skies of each weekly sunrise and sunset over Fanewick in a myriad of scintillating colors. They could not be lazier the rest of the week, and their demeanor is exceedingly unpleasant, offended that anyone would ask a favor of them during their time off. Oove, the Watcher of the Night Bloom: He is one of the few local gods who has never been seen, but he is often heard in the wilds at night, whispering directions to lost travelers, pointing them to the nearest source of night bloom. Locals claim he leads those who displease him or harm nocturnal creatures into dangerous terrain. It’s rumored that he watches over Fanewick nights from his home on the moon. Qui’Gar, Whispered Sweetness for a Thorny End: A quiet god who presides over the deaths of those who pass in thorny bushes and briar patches. Traditionally, she doesn’t receive many visitors, but the Witherwild’s corruptive growth has made her job harder and upended her quiet existence. Rohkin, the Wandering Horn: Rohkin watches over the many herds of horned creatures that reside in Fanewick. In happier times, he preserved the balance of nature and civilization, preventing overhunting. But since the corruption of the Witherwild has taken hold, he’s seen his herds change into unrecognizable, dangerous beasts. These are but a small slice of the hundreds, if not thousands, of Faint Divinities lurking, relaxing, hunting, and playing throughout Fanewick. • What Faint Divinities do the PCs acknowledge and pay tribute to, if any? • How has the Witherwild changed the outlook, personality, and dispositions of the Faint Divinities the characters encounter? • Which gods ally themselves with Haven to preserve the endless spring?

The Reaping Eye is stowed in a secure vault beneath the central tower of Haven’s wizarding school, seemingly impossible to recover. A secretive and dangerous rebel group, led by a mysterious figure known only as the Fanewraith (she/her), has hatched a plan to end the curse of the Witherwild: find the Great Owl, Nikta, and pluck out the Sowing Eye. While this may solve the immediate problem, the long-term consequences are not being considered, just as they weren’t when Haven invaded. Haven’s beleaguered spymaster, Kreil Dirn (he/him), is not a popular person in Haven. He is responsible for rooting out insurgents, stopping schemes before they have a chance to start, and keeping a close watch on Haven’s internal activities. Kreil has never agreed—at least not openly—with Archmage Phylax’s (they/them) decision to steal the Reaping Eye, and the consequences they’ve all paid for that decision have been grimly vindicating. Recently, Kreil uncovered the Fanewraith’s plot and is horrified by the possibility of her success. Knowing he can’t send a troop of Haven soldiers deep into the woods to hunt down and stop the Fanewraith from stealing the Sowing Eye, Kreil uses his vast network of informants and spies to find a group of adventurers who can bring the Fanewraith to swift justice. The party is sent an invitation from Haven to meet with Kreil. But is his information correct? Does he have his own motivation or secret ambition? Whether they come from Fanewick or Haven, the party must extend some trust to a person who is equally as dangerous and mercurial as the “enemy” they pursue. And what will they do when they find the Fanewraith? Bring her to justice? Side with her? Attempt to recover the Reaping Eye? Kreil advises the party to start their hunt for the Fanewraith in the treetop village of Alula, where he suspects she runs her operation. CAMPAIGN MECHANICS The following mechanics are unique to this campaign. Corruption from the Witherwild Adversaries and environments in this campaign can gain an additional type called Withered. When an adversary is Withered, describe how the Witherwild changed or impacted how they would normally appear or operate. You also need about 20 Wither tokens (these can be the same as the tokens you use for Fear). Any time a PC takes Severe damage from a Withered adversary or environment, gain a Wither token and place it on that PC’s character sheet. When you do, the PC must roll their Fear Die. If they roll equal to or below the number of Wither tokens on their sheet, they immediately gain a scar and clear all tokens, describing how the Witherwild changes them permanently. At the end of each session, clear all Wither tokens from the PCs’ sheets and gain an equal amount of Fear. If a character ever dies with Wither tokens on their sheet, their body is permanently taken over by the Witherwild. SESSION ZERO QUESTIONS Ask any of these questions to your players, or make your own. • What dangerous animal comes out during the week of night that isn’t out during the week of day? • What unique trait (such as appearance, smell, or taste) does anything tainted by the Witherwild have? • What superstitions does your character or their community have about traversing Fanewick during the long nights? • Your character has witnessed something beautiful that came from the Witherwild. What is it and how has it transformed their view of the corruption? • If your character is from Fanewick, what commodity do they secretly enjoy that comes from Haven?

Designed by Mike Underwood Complexity Rating: •• THE PITCH Read this section to your players to introduce them to the campaign. Five years into an armistice that ended a decade of warfare, the threat of renewed conflict looms over the continent of Althas. Five nations in a delicate web of alliances and rivalries seek to exploit the opportunities granted by this period of rapid magical, political, and social change. All five nations deploy agents to strengthen alliances, sabotage foes, and tip the balance of power in their favor. In a Five Banners Burning campaign, you’ll play heroes caught up in the twisting and ever-escalating conflict between nations, contending with competing loyalties, generational grudges, and opportunistic villains.

The following five nations comprise the continent of Althas: Armada is a federation of city-states founded by pirates- turned-merchants. Uninterested in paying back the fortunes stolen by their forebears, they seek strength and recognition through naval superiority. Armada is allied with Jesthaen and is disliked by Voldaen and Hilltop. Hilltop is a rich theocracy that exerts a monopoly on access to the gods, giving them holdings in the other nations’ settlements from capitals down to villages. Hilltop is an old ally of Voldaen and is unfriendly toward Armada and Jesthaen. Jesthaen is a young republic recently independent from Voldaen after a bloody but short war. They seek to prove their strength through displays of military might. Jesthaen is allied with Armada and allies of convenience with Polaris. Polaris is a progress-focused magocracy at the beginning of a magical industrial revolution. They are ideological rivals with Voldaen and allies of convenience with Jesthaen. Voldaen is a proud monarchy with traditional authority and riches, recently shaken by Jesthaen’s secession. They are an old ally of Hilltop and ideological rivals of Polaris. These five nations once flew under one banner. In the age of gods, the divinities protected their mortal creations, clashing with primordial powers of chaos and striking them down. With victory secured, the peoples of Althas crowned their first queen—a dwarven seraph named Arvold—and founded the nation of Voldaen. Meanwhile, the gods established their seat in what is now known as Hilltop, but departed centuries later to fight otherworldly foes. Over the next several centuries, factional differences within Voldaen grew untenable. With the gods absent, their priests asserted their authority as divine regents of Hilltop. Later, a group of scholars and mages who wished to push the boundaries of arcane knowledge broke off and founded the nation of Polaris. Alliances of pirate navies began settling down in trade cities, forming the federation of Armada. And just fifteen years ago, groups of workers and anti-monarchists declared independence from Voldaen to establish their own nation, known as Jesthaen. This bloody revolution consumed the continent, with Hilltop coming to Voldaen’s aid while Polaris and Armada supported the Jesthaen rebels. Active combat ended five years ago with an armistice, but the peace remains tenuous. The emergence of Jesthaen as a nascent military force has redrawn the lines of power, challenging Voldaen and Hilltop’s traditional authority. But the alliance between Polaris and the upstart nations of Armada and Jesthaen is fragile, and there are many in both Voldaen and Jesthaen with unfinished business from the war. Minor border clashes and trade disputes threaten to boil over. Many believe that war is coming again—it’s only a matter of when and how. Five Banners Burning is an emotionally intense campaign with a large cast and sweeping scope, where the characters will find themselves in the crucible that forges the fate of nations. The campaign leans toward a nuanced moral landscape, with morality and ethics in tension with duty and allegiance. Heroes may do terrible things that weigh upon them, and most villains are motivated by love and loyalty as often as ambition or vengeance. FIVE BANNERS BURNING 263 Chapter 5: Five Banners Burning"

As needed, provide the following information to your players and choose one or more of the questions to ask them during your session zero. Highborne and Orderborne Althas’ highborne and orderborne communities play an especially central role in this campaign, as they are most strongly associated with the centers of power in the five nations. Highborne characters are likely connected to the ruling class of the five major nations of Althas. • Are you a member of the aristocracy or nobility, or the scion of a prominent merchant or priest family? • What expectations does your community have of you, and do you intend to live up to them? Defined by their relationship to strongly held tenets, orderborne communities are most common in Hilltop and Voldaen. An orderborne character will have their community’s ideals tested by the conflict between nations—those that live by a code will be called to die for it. • How do you see the tenets you grew up with being changed or broken as tensions rise? • What lines are you willing to cross to protect the people you love? Ridgeborne, Underborne, and Wildborne Althas is a mountainous continent, and Ridgeborne communities are common in every nation, often feeling more kinship with one another than the lowlander communities. Underborne communities can be found beneath mountaintops, in oceanside caverns, and deeper still. Wildborne communities are more rare, often founded by people interested in escaping the larger conflicts of Althas. • What resources or assets does your community have that other nations might want to take for themselves? • Who from your community was conscripted in past conflicts, and what tales do they tell of their battles? Loreborne Loreborne communities are especially prominent in Polaris— including magic academics, engineers, architects, and other scholars—but these communities exist in every nation. For example, priests safeguard religious histories and knowledge in Hilltop, while sages advise families and maintain the continuity of knowledge in Voldaen. • What kind of knowledge does your community prioritize, and how does it influence the powerful figures in your home nation? • What secrets does your community protect or control? What impact would those secrets have on the burgeoning conflict? Seaborne Seaborne communities are common across Althas, save in landlocked Polaris. They are home to the continent’s most accomplished sailors, navigators, and fisherpeople, torn between a life lived tide-to-tide and the pull to duty in serving nations once more on the brink of war. • How is naval power being exercised in your community? • What do you fear will happen if the conflict comes to your community by land? Slyborne Slyborne communities are found across Althas, but are especially prominent in Jesthaen and Armada. There, criminal organizations have been instrumental in improving their nations’ fortunes, from smugglers supporting the Jesthaen revolution to the tight-knit pirate families that founded Armada with goods taken from Voldaen, Polaris, and Hilltop. • What is your community’s relationship to their nation? How are they using the political instability to their advantage? • What communities from other nations does your community do business with? How are those connections strained? Wanderborne Wanderborne characters belong to no single region of Althas—but though they may consider themselves outside the authority of the five nations, it will be very difficult to avoid the brewing conflict. • Are your people claimed as subjects of one of the nations? • How has the growing conflict altered your community’s travels?

CLASSES All classes are available, but some have unique aspects within a Five Banners Burning campaign. PLAYER PRINCIPLES If your group decides to play this campaign, give your players the following information before character creation. Make Your Actions Reflect or Refute Your Allegiances You will be implicated in the actions of your superiors, who may, at times, give questionable orders and condemn you for any signs of dissent. Consider your character’s loyalty to those they serve—every action they take is a chance to strengthen their reflection of an ideal or stand against something they oppose. Weave your character’s arc through bold choices until there’s a clear, compelling difference between where they once stood and where they now stand. Stick to Your Principles or Break Them for Good Reasons Decide where you draw your lines and what it will take for you to cross them. Share your character’s struggle with the party as they try to reconcile their actions with the ideals they profess. Take Small Actions That Have Big Implications Find your moment to make a difference, to push back against the overwhelming external forces that strain the people of this continent to their breaking point. Build the future you want one step at a time—a small gesture for you might mean the world to someone else. Grapple with the Impact of Your Actions on Everyday People Treat every person as important and foster hope in places where fear moves people to wrath or despair. When your character becomes a symbol people look up to when things are dire, explore whether they embody that heroism or reject the lionizing. GM PRINCIPLES Keep the following guidance in mind while you GM this campaign. Force Them to Choose Between Their Loyalties Put allies at cross purposes and force the characters to take a side. Make it impossible to keep everyone happy, forcing the characters to pay the price of compromise, whether personal, political, or both. Entangle Them in a Web of Old Grudges and New Schemes Show how people are motivated by both inherited ideology and personal ambitions. Highlight the rising tensions and dramatize the breaking points. Pull on the characters with the weight of history and the gravity of ambition. Put the Party in the Crucible of History Manifest dramatic moments through drastic action. For example, create a historic opportunity for compromise and peace, then fill the room with NPCs who will do anything to stop it. Position the party so they can always impact these major events—that they are the catalysts and fulcrums of history. Zoom In and Out to Show the Far-Reaching Impact of Decisions Show the wide impact an individual’s actions can have, and draw the line of influence from their motivations to the consequences. Whether that be an adversary’s zeal influencing their militant government to battle, or the character’s bold decisions, make their actions reverberate, playing out cause and effect like a stack of falling dominos.

A World on the Edge Five Banners Burning features a setting on the verge of open warfare. When that war will break out depends on you, but it is almost inevitable. The conflict between nations will be fought in ballrooms and back alleys as much as in castles and valleys, and people from all backgrounds will be caught in the growing conflict despite their best efforts. Tipping the Scales of History The party will be in a unique position to have a significant impact on the conflict between these nations. Ensure they’re connected to the major players, factions, leaders, or other catalysts so they’re always in the thick of the conflict. Big Questions To best engage with the thematic elements of this campaign, keep these questions in mind throughout each session: • Does power always corrupt? • In what ways is the road to disaster paved with good intentions? • What does just governance look like? • How do you decide who to protect and uplift with limited resources? • How do you manage divided loyalties without betraying someone, including yourself? Collateral Damage As conflict escalates, it will displace monsters from their ecosystems, upset the natural and magical balance of Althas, and drive people from their homes to become refugees within or beyond their nation’s borders.

FIVE BANNERS BURNING 266 Chapter 5: Five Banners Burning\n-- 267 of 415 --\nTHE INCITING INCIDENT You can use the prompt below to start your campaign, or create your own. Clover of Towers (orderborne firbolg, they/them), the child of Jesthaen revolutionary hero Adamant Towers (orderborne firbolg, she/her), was kidnapped on the way to a political marriage to Enchanter Kalashae (loreborne orc, she/her), a rising star in Polaris’s High Circle of mages. Polaris is wary of Jesthaen’s claim that Clover has been kidnapped and demands that Jesthaen follow through with the political marriage. Voldaen denies all involvement and sends a diplomatic investigative party to Lightning Valley, a border town known both for the giant lightning rods that protect the town from magical storms and for hosting the talks that ended official hostilities between Voldaen and the revolutionary faction. However, days later, reports tell of some kind of “disaster” during the initial meetings between Voldaen and Jesthaen’s representatives. The party is sent to Lightning Valley to investigate what happened. There, they find representatives from other nations doing the same—the apprentice of a disappeared mage- inquisitor, a divine seeker from Hilltop investigating potential divine implications, a Voldaen judge who once served as the town magistrate “returning to visit family,” and a merchant- diplomat from Armada. The following NPCs comprise the cast embroiled in this mystery: Clover of Towers wants to make their mother proud and find a way to be happy far from home. Before their kidnapping, they were last seen drinking with city guards at the Three Poles tavern, built between several lightning poles. They were too young to fight in the war, and they have a sense of inferiority about not having bled for the freedom they now enjoy. Oziver of Storms, sheriff of Lightning Valley (ridgeborne simiah, he/him), is trying to keep the peace but is quickly becoming overwhelmed by the attention and stakes. Oziver is eager for help but needs reassurance of any outsider’s goodwill. He knows that a city guard was the last to be seen with Clover, but he’s convinced the still-missing guard isn’t to blame. Cerulean Prism, apprentice Mage-Inquisitor of Polaris (loreborne clank, he/him), is quiet and diligent, though worried by Clover’s sudden disappearance. While working for Enchanter Kalashae, Cerulean managed correspondence with Clover during the marriage negotiations. They’ve fallen for the firbolg and will take reckless action to find them. Kostren, Seeker of Hilltop (orderborne halfling, she/her), is a formidable presence used to being obeyed. She takes over the local temple as her base of operations, conscripting the clergy for a divination ritual that will locate Clover. She tells anyone that will listen of her vision that “proves” foul play by the mages of Polaris. Kostren is exaggerating the certainty of this vision to stoke renewed conflict so that Hilltop can claim more fertile land. Zeshthon, County Judge of Voldaen (highborne dwarf, they/them), is an elderly dwarf with a compelling silence about them that people can’t help but fill with conversation. They volunteered for the inquiry so they could visit their grandniece, a cobbler residing in the town. A dedicated art collector, Zesthon hopes to procure embargoed tapestries from Goledraelle, which could lead to exposing the merchant’s true identity as a spy. Goledraelle, merchant of Armada (seaborne elf, he/him), is a charming but hapless-seeming textiles merchant. This image of incompetence is a cover he deploys to throw off suspicion of his true agenda; in truth, Goledraelle is an Armadan spy dispatched to ensure the marriage happens as planned. The original investigators arrived two days after Clover’s disappearance and set out into the hills to the east, but have not checked in for over a week. Did they suffer the same fate as the firbolg? What help from the townsfolk did the kidnappers have, and who else knows about it? Which enemies of Jesthaen, Polaris, or Armada were in position to sabotage the marriage? Was the marriage sabotaged by someone within Jesthaen for other reasons? Did some danger or threat lead Clover from the town without their escort? Or was this part of Clover’s plan all along, a chance to live free of their mother’s expectations? Which of the second wave of investigators will be the first to learn where Clover went? Who escalates to violence first, and what version of that story catches on like wildfire? FIVE BANNERS BURNING 267 Chapter 5: Five Banners Burning"

Faction Relationships Use a campaign sheet to track the relationships between the nations, as well as their major assets and problems. Each nation has a relationship rating with the other nations, ranging from Nemeses (−3) to Close Allies (+3). The more intense the relationship, the more the nation will act for or against the other nation, even at risk to themselves. Nations that are Friendly (+1) will render help if it does not require much effort or risk, but nations that are Nemeses (−3) will go out on a limb just to see the other suffer. ARMADA Relationships: Allies (+2) with Jesthaen, Friendly (+1) with Polaris, Unfriendly (−1) with Voldaen, Enemies (−2) with Hilltop Assets: Large and powerful navy, superior maps of ocean & wind currents, allied water monsters Problems: Small land area, limited overland access to the main continent, lingering reputation as pirates and thieves Major Objectives: Build friendly port infrastructure in Voldaen and Polaris for trade Minor Objectives: Acquire airship technology, deploy privateers against adversaries HILLTOP Relationships: Allies (+2) with Voldaen, Enemies (−2) with Armada, Enemies (−2) with Jesthaen, Nemeses (−3) with Polaris Assets: Wealth from tithes, a devout army, priests and seraphs, divine power and authority, influence and intelligence through temples and shrines Problems: Surrounded by adversaries, negligible navy, scarcity of domestically produced food Major Objective: Bring the Armadan miscreants back into the fold and redeem them Minor Objectives: Beseech the gods for a bountiful harvest, implicate Polaris as the supporters of a Fallen cult JESTHAEN Relationships: Allies (+2) with Armada, Friendly (+1) with Polaris, Enemies (−2) with Hilltop, Nemeses (−3) with Voldaen Assets: A strong land-based military, natural resources, large amounts of arable land Problems: Political instability as a new nation, remaining conservative elements loyal to Voldaen Major Objective: Take revenge on Voldaen for injustices across centuries Minor Objectives: Secure enduring trade partnerships with Armada and Polaris, take control of local temples from Hilltop POLARIS Relationships: Friendly (+1) with Armada, Friendly (+1) with Jesthaen, Enemies (−2) with Voldaen, Nemeses (−3) with Hilltop Assets: Skilled mages, magitech innovations, airships, magical creatures Problems: Lack of workers, poor quality and scarce raw materials Major Objective: Perfect magical servitor enchantments Minor Objectives: Secure new mines and quarries, foster immigration through job programs VOLDAEN Relationships: Allies (+2) with Hilltop, Unfriendly (−1) with Armada, Enemies (−2) with Polaris, Nemeses (−3) with Jesthaen Assets: Traditional political and cultural authority, seemingly boundless wealth Problems: Strategic vulnerability due to major settlements close to large borders with Polaris and Jesthaen, political upheaval following Jesthaen’s separatist revolution Major Objective: Reclaim key resources from Jesthaen without starting another war Minor Objectives: Turn Armada against their allies, steal magical talent and technology from Polaris FIVE BANNERS BURNING Hilltop Jesthaen Polaris Voldaen Armada 268 Chapter 5: Five Banners Burning"

Each in-game week, pick one countdown for each nation to advance (step down the countdown by one tick) as they make progress on their goal. These countdowns can also tick up or down if their progress is influenced by the fiction. A completed countdown represents a nation gaining access to an asset, removing a problem, developing new technology or initiatives, changing political or social fortunes, or acquiring an equally useful benefit. When a countdown is completed, pick a new objective based on the fiction and start a new countdown. Each nation can have one major objective countdown and up to two minor objective countdowns at a time. Completing major objectives requires a 10-step countdown, while minor objectives have 4 to 6 steps depending on the scale of the endeavor. Stagger the nations’ countdowns so that as they start completing, only one or two are reaching an objective and changing the political landscape each week; if you trigger all five nations’ countdowns at the same time, there will be weeks of inactivity afterward, lessening the tension of the brewing conflicts. The party may often be dispatched or mobilized to complete or block these objectives. Meanwhile, completed countdowns generate major narrative shifts for the party to respond to. SESSION ZERO QUESTIONS Ask any of these questions to your players, or make your own. • Should all the characters come from and/or have allegiance to the same nation? Why are they allied and traveling together? • How big of a role will war play in this campaign compared to other elements like diplomacy, intrigue, or mystery? • How much conflict do we want between PCs? What safety tools will we use to negotiate those conflicts when they occur? Example: The party spends a week traveling by airship from Armada to Polaris to seek counsel from High Circle scholars about ancient script discovered in an abandoned ruin. During that time, the GM chooses one countdown per nation to advance as time passes. First, they tick down Voldaen’s 10-step countdown to seize one of Armada’s shipping fleets from 7 to 6, representing the nation’s scouts and sailors observing the current state of Armada’s navy: how many ships the pirates have, what kinds of ships they are, and what they’re being used for. Inspired by a scene where the PCs had to prove their magical prowess to the Polaris captain to secure passage, the GM chooses to tick down Armada’s 4-step countdown to acquire airship technology from Polaris, representing Armada’s diplomatic and trade efforts to access the carefully guarded magitech. For Hilltop, the GM ticks down their 4-step countdown— representing a massive ritual to bless this year’s harvest and increase their yield—from 1 to 0, completing the countdown. The GM makes a note to spread news of its success, as this addresses Hilltop’s food shortage. They also note to think of a new countdown for Hilltop. Polaris has two projects with 3 ticks remaining, so the GM decides to tick down their major countdown to perfect their servitor technology to 2 as the magitechnicians scale up wider tests of the promising prototype. Lastly, the GM ticks down Jesthaen’s project—taking religious authority in their nation from Hilltop—to 4. This countdown had recently ticked up from 4 to 5 after the PCs chose to investigate cult rumors in Armada rather than assist Jesthaen in convincing Hilltop priests to cede authority.

Long ago, within the heart of the Plover Caves, Hylaeus the Forest Mage (she/her) cast a powerful spell, creating a Lure that draws dangerous creatures from the surrounding area into the caverns. For centuries, this kept any harm from coming to the village of Elmore. However, the caves are now filled to the brim with strange, unexpected creatures from across the region—and the remnants of outsiders brave or foolhardy enough to venture into them. But nobody from Elmore is foolish enough to be caught dead in the caves. The quiet, rustic village is full of bakers and weavers, farmers and cobblers, with ne’er a sword in sight. The villagers are more concerned about not mucking up their contribution to the yearly Stewpot Festival than the dangers outside their walls. That was until the village’s beloved halfling mayor Doug Dougle (he/him) was attacked by a dangerous creature during his daily hike through Plover Woods. The Lure created by Hylaeus all those years ago is fading, and with it, Elmore’s protection. As increasingly dangerous beasts stalk the woods, the villagers have banded together to reignite the ancient spell, calling on anyone who might pick up a blade to descend into the caves and save their people. Unfortunately, the defenseless people of Elmore have ceased hunting and foraging in Plover Woods for fear of attack until the Lure is reactivated—there isn’t much to spare, so every bite in town is precious. Anyone venturing into the caves will have to hunt and prepare their own food while they’re down there! The easiest way to find the Plover Caves is to take the western road out of Elmore and follow the birdsong of piping plovers. Old tales from this area say these small birds are the only creatures that move freely in and out of the tunnels without losing themselves to the depths, so following them almost always leads to an entrance—or an exit. The old tales also say the Plover Caves are endless—this isn’t true, but it might as well be. They stretch on for hundreds of miles underground, deeper and more sprawling than even the most adventurous explorer could map in their lifetime. The entry path leads down on a sharp decline for miles until it finally splits into many branches leading to various regions within the cave system. Here, different biomes are home to unique creatures, wonderous flora, and valuable treasures left behind by adventurers past. The deeper you go, the more dangerous and delicious the creatures are, and the more precious and powerful the treasure is. And even deeper still lies the Lure. Those from Elmore might be surprised to find there are many people happily living and working in the dark, dangerous caverns. Most reside in camps, but more permanent residents have small cabins carved out of rock along the tunnels. The culture in the Plover Caves is very communal, and ambitious folks have set up shops for bartering or trade. Most major caverns even host a Berry’s—the chain of small restaurants that serve the catch of the day, fresh and hot, in exchange for gold. Residents might stop in when they’re too tired or ingredient-poor to cook for themselves, but Berry’s restaurants are also hubs for gossip, entertainment, and warnings about what dangerous beasts might be lurking nearby.

As needed, provide the following information to your players and choose one or more of the questions to ask them during your session zero. All Communities In a Beast Feast campaign, the characters are villagers from Elmore. If a player wants to create a character whose chosen community wouldn’t be found in this peaceful village, work with them to determine where their character originally came from. Perhaps they grew up in an orderborne community and moved to Elmore to be in a less restrictive environment, or they were a slyborne adventurer who settled in the village after retiring from their shady deeds. The following sections describe a few communities in more detail and how they could tie into this campaign. Underborne Underborne folk may be from the Plover Caves, but even if not, they will likely thrive in this labyrinth. Their eyes need not adjust to the darkness, nor do their hands quake at the touch of the sour ants crawling in the dirt. This is home for them. • Despite being accustomed to your own underground environment, what’s something you’ve heard is unique about the Plover Caves? • You have a particular dish from your own cave system that you’re hoping to cook on this adventure. What makes it special? • You were injured by a cave creature once. How did that experience change you? Ridgeborne The rocky, rough environment is familiar to ridgeborne characters. Though the cuisine is probably much different than they’re used to, they’re likely accustomed to catching, killing, and preparing their own food. • What specific dish do you miss from home? • You struggle with a lack of open space. What do you plan to carry with you to help steady your nerves? • You think a lesson from the mountains will help you in the Plover Caves. What did you learn, and how did you learn it? Loreborne As devourers of knowledge, loreborne characters might believe the Plover Caves provide a unique opportunity to observe a strange ecosystem that brings together beasts that would never normally live in the same environment. • What rumor about the beasts in Plover Caves have you heard? How has that changed how you operate in the caverns? • What specific piece of knowledge are you seeking while underground? • You plan to record information to bring back to someone. Who is it, and why is this so important to you? ANCESTRIES All ancestries are available, but some have unique aspects within a Beast Feast campaign. As needed, provide the following information to your players. Clanks Clanks can consume organic matter, but they may lack the ability to taste the food. Instead, they might enjoy the culinary arts for other qualities, such as texture or aesthetics. Fungril Fungril can hear mushrooms screaming as they are harvested. Unfortunately, a majority of plant life in the Plover Caves is fungi—adventurers might need to find alternative ingredients if it helps make cooking a more shame-free activity. CLASSES All classes are available, but some have unique aspects within a Beast Feast campaign. As needed, provide the following information to your players. All Classes The people of Elmore have lived peacefully for generations. Thanks to Hylaeus, the region’s dangerous creatures are enticed to the caves; meanwhile, other towns or armies have largely left the unassuming village alone. When players select martial abilities or spells, they should consider how and why their characters learned these techniques or what skills they’ve adapted on this journey.

Build on Humble Origins When you make a character for this campaign, they should be a villager from Elmore who has gathered what tools they can to descend into the Plover Caves in hopes of saving their people. Think about what quaint or mundane job your character holds in the village and how it might have prepared them for their new role as a hero. Perhaps they’re a florist who knows about plants, a clockmaker with dexterous fingers, a mage who runs a humble potion shop, a blacksmith with a strong hammer-arm, or a chef with a particular adeptness for knives. Use your character’s occupation as inspiration for their experiences, the kind of weapon they carry, and how to flavor any features you choose for your character. Slay and Filet Have you tried eating it? No? Well, then how do you know it’s not food? Carry a curious mindset with you as your character explores the caves, learning about the various beasts and blooms that could make a delicious meal (and potentially an excellent addition to your cookbook). Balance Comedy and Heart If there’s a place for a silly character name, a low-stakes yet important life goal, a weird personality quirk, or a zany aesthetic, it’s this campaign frame. Embrace the fun, make bold choices, and look for opportunities to set up your character’s allies for comedic moments. Additionally, let your character experience vulnerability, reveal a hard personal truth, or bond with another character over something important to them. Strive to balance comedic and heartfelt moments. GM PRINCIPLES Keep the following guidance in mind while you GM this campaign. Make It Delicious Describe the world through a fun, over-the-top culinary lens. When describing beasts, highlight the parts of them that could be particularly useful in a dish or valuable to a specific recipe. When describing the environment, lean on the PCs’ senses— especially smell and taste—to draw them in and provide details they don’t see. Use food-related colors (“the glass orb you find is the color of rich honey”), names (“she introduces herself as Penelope Pepperbottom”), and comparisons (“you march your way through the sludge of the tunnel, thick like molasses”) to immerse your players in the world. Give Them Purpose Though it can be fun to slay some beasts and make some meals, the novelty will soon wear off if the story you’re telling doesn’t have purpose and stakes. While the long-term goal might be to reach the Lure and revitalize its magic, ensure you introduce short-term goals and break the adventure up into more session-to-session story developments. Give players a reason to return to Elmore every few sessions to contrast the world above and the world below. Create Personal Conflict Crafting meals isn’t just about slaying beasts to make great dinner; it’s also about competing with other Plover Caves delvers for the finest ingredients! Introduce conflict, such as rivals who want to see the PCs fail so they can gain control of the Plover Caves. Make ingredients scarce so that when word breaks out that a popular protein is nearby, the party must race to claim it before others do. BEAST FEAST 273 Chapter 5: Beast Feast"

A Cave of Wonders Plover Caves’ biomes are as varied as any surface biomes, and often stranger and more disconcerting. A windstorm might whip through the tunnels, uprooting massive plants and blocking exits. A sudden, excessive expulsion of moisture from the weeping skyflowers overhead might cause a torrential downpour that floods a cave. A cavern’s ground might be so soft and thick that you begin to sink if you stand still too long. Some even refer to the Plover Caves as a distinct entity itself—not just a cave system, but a massive creature of its own. Additionally, there are distinct features within the caves most adventurers will stumble across: Layers of the cavern represent how deep an adventurer is within the Plover Caves, with each layer representing between 200 and 500 vertical feet. Common adventurers generally stay within the first layer, but the most ambitious venture deeper. Most stories describe four distinct layers (The Shallows, Twilight, Abyss, and Hadral), but veteran explorers have told tales of many, many more. Brilliance is a geodesic dome that shines so brightly it mimics the sunlight from the outside world. Some veteran explorers practice meditation and morning rituals in this dome, often asking one another, “Will you be at Brilliance today?” Reflection of the Stars is Plover Caves’ primary lake. It’s fed by an underground spring and sits beneath a ceiling dotted with bioluminescent morsels, such as the glowing mantis and the brightclaw scorpion. The aquatic creatures who call this place home range from small almond guppies to medium-sized jellyfish to the dreaded ironshark and the massive angler squid, whose many eyes are considered a delicacy. The Catacombs are the deepest point of the third layer of the cavern, thus named because the ground is covered in so many layers of bones, one cannot step without breaking a few and drawing attention to themself. Some of Plover Caves’ residents say the most horrifying beasts bring their prey to the Catacombs for consumption, making it a hotbed of dangerous creatures. Passing through the Catacombs successfully is the only way to explore deeper than the Abyss. Beasts and Blooms This campaign uses the terms beasts and blooms for the animals and plants/fungi that are edible in this world. Anything with distinct personhood isn’t considered a beast or a bloom, even if they resemble something that would otherwise be edible—for example, fungril and drakona. Because the magical Lure compels creatures from across the region into the Plover Caves, an endless variety of strange beasts and blooms live within them—not just ones normally found in caves! In this world, it would make sense to find a pack of velociraptors descending on a six-legged dire ostrich that is, in turn, snacking on a patch of starfish mushrooms. These caves hold an ecosystem unlike any other, and every edible thing that could exist down here likely does. The Lure The Lure is the orb of concentrated magic created by Hylaeus the Forest Mage to trap dangerous creatures within the Plover Caves. It’s most commonly believed the Lure resides somewhere in the lowest levels of the Hadral layer, but no one is certain where. Because so little is known about this great source of power, there are many questions to answer about it over the course of the campaign: • How was it made? • What was sacrificed to create it? • Why has its power started to fade? • What will the PCs need to do to activate it again?

After the attack on Mayor Dougle, the local alchemist, Carat (they/them), approaches the party. Worried for the safety of the town, they ask the party to delve into the Plover Caves to locate a particular ingredient—ghost scorpion venom. Carat can transmute twelve drops of this venom into a spicy paste, which they can spread around the borders of the village to temporarily keep dangerous creatures at bay. Carat explains that ghost scorpions tend to make their nests by flattening the tall grasses of the Overgrowth into strange circular patterns. To get to the Overgrowth, the party can follow the smell of jasmine through the northernmost chamber of the Shallows. But if they ever smell lavender— RUN. What will the characters encounter that makes them realize the failing Lure is a problem that needs addressing? What will they accomplish that shows them they’re capable of exploring further in? What about the community will coax them into returning—and what competition will light a fire in their veins?

The party will create a cookbook together as they play through this campaign frame. The players should choose a small notebook they can share, then decorate it as they’d like (stickers, colored markers, and paint are highly encouraged). This notebook is their cookbook—during downtime, they’ll record each recipe they make, including its name, the ingredients, the cooking method, and how it turned out. The cookbook is shared by the players, who should all get the chance to contribute to it. The more the characters practice making meals with the same flavor profile, the easier that combination becomes to prepare! The Beast Feast! During downtime, the PCs recover from their adventuring by making a meal from the bounty of ingredients gathered from the caverns. Every ingredient PCs gather has a flavor profile, which is determined by the 1–3 flavors that comprise it and the strength of those flavors. Each flavor has a die size associated with it: → Sweet (d4) → Salty (d6) → Bitter (d8) → Sour (d10) → Savory (d12) → Weird (d20) A flavor’s strength is a value between 1 and 3, which is the number of the flavor’s associated dice the players roll when cooking with the ingredient. A PC can hold a number of ingredients equal to the value of their highest character trait. The following list provides examples of ingredients and their flavor profiles: • Mushroom caps: Bitter (1), Savory (2) • Wyvern tongue: Sour (1), Savory (1), Weird (1) • Ooze marrow: Sweet (1), Bitter (2) • Direbear meat: Savory (3) • Acid dragon saliva: Sour (2) • Cave boar milk: Salty (1), Savory (1) • Rileroot: Bitter (1) • Ogre kidney stone: Sweet (1), Weird (1) Example: In this case, mushroom caps would contribute 1d8 and 2d12 to the meal. Hunting Beasts for Ingredients! Every beast that PCs fight provides ingredients they can harvest. A beast’s maximum Hit Points determine how many ingredients they produce. Hit Point Guide → 4 or lower: 1 ingredient → 5–7: 2 ingredients → 8–10: 3 ingredients → 12 or higher: 4 ingredients While the adversary’s Hit Points determine the number of ingredients, you set the flavor profile and strength. Use the narrative details of the adversary to inform these choices. Often, less difficult adversaries have flavor profiles with smaller dice (Sweet, Salty, and Bitter), and more powerful adversaries have flavor profiles with larger dice (Sour, Savory, and Weird). Gathering Blooms for Ingredients! PCs can also obtain ingredients from their environment— these are called blooms. Once per rest, each PC can spend a Hope to gather blooms from their surroundings. You can tell them what they find or have them roll their Hope Die and gain one bloom with a flavor profile based on the following table: 1–2 3–4 5–6 7–8 9–10 11–12 Sweet (1) Salty (1) Bitter (1) Sour (1) Savory (1) Weird (1) 277 Chapter 5: Beast Feast"

During downtime, players can’t choose downtime moves to clear Stress, clear Hit Points, or gain Hope. Instead, they have a new downtime move: Make a Feast. When they choose this move, the PCs can contribute any ingredients they’re carrying to the party’s collective meal and gain the benefits of the resulting feast. The PCs who choose to Make a Feast during downtime prepare the food together. They should collaborate to decide which ingredients they’re using, then erase those ingredients from their inventory. Then they come up with a name and description for the dish and record it in their party’s cookbook. When the PCs begin cooking, they roll the appropriate number of flavor dice. For example, the party decides to make a steak dinner with the following recipe: • 1 serving of direbear meat → 3d12 • 1 serving of mushroom caps → 2d12 + 1d8 • 1 serving of ooze marrow → 2d8 + 1d4 This gives the party 5d12, 3d8, and 1d4 as the meal’s flavor dice. They roll the dice and look for any matching values. If there are no matching values, they discard a single die of their choice, then roll the pool again to continue cooking. When they get any number of matching values, players collect those dice off to the side and continue rolling. When they have only one die left, the meal is done! Next, players take each set of matched dice (which can consist of two or more dice per set) and add their values together. For example, a d6 and a d8 that rolled matching 3s would be worth 3. A d10 and d12 that rolled matching 4s would be worth 4. A d8 and a d20 that rolled matching 4s (on a different roll) would also be worth 4. Together, they have a Meal Rating of 11. All PCs who eat the meal can individually use the value of the Meal Rating to clear Hit Points, clear Stress, and gain Hope, dividing this value however they’d like. For example, with a Meal Rating of 11, one PC might choose to clear 6 Hit Points, clear 4 Stress, and gain 1 Hope. Another might choose to clear 5 Hit Points, clear 4 Stress, and gain 2 Hope. Anytime a party makes a dish with the same flavor profile as another recipe they’ve previously recorded in their cookbook, they should add a number of tokens equal to the party’s current tier to their pool of flavor dice. When they must discard a die, they can instead discard one of these tokens. QUICK INGREDIENT GENERATOR! When the PCs harvest an ingredient, roll a d20 on each relevant table and use the combination to inspire what they gather. If one of the options doesn’t fit the scenario, choose another that does.

If you roll any matches on your flavor dice, your Meal Rating is 0 and you must make a death move. Berry’s Restaurant When the PCs are near an open Berry’s Restaurant during their downtime, they can each spend a handful of gold to order food and choose a downtime move to clear Stress, clear Hit Points, or gain Hope. Only 2 handfuls of gold can be spent per PC during downtime.

Designed by Matthew Mercer Complexity Rating: ••• THE PITCH Read this section to your players to introduce them to the campaign. A century has passed since the God-King Othedias betrayed the Pantheon, provoking divine punishment and abandonment by the gods that left the realm of the Halcyon Domain shattered, desolate, and eternally cursed. Throughout this shadow-choked land of decaying fortresses and dreadful monstrosities, surviving communities cling to hope in the face of lightless oblivion. In an Age of Umbra campaign, you’ll play heroic survivors who protect their community from the terrors beyond their walls, venture out into the unknown to hunt the nightmares that twist and grow with each fallen soul, seek answers to the curses that corrupt this world, and perhaps even discover a way to change its fate.

The Age of Umbra is a dark and broken age within the realm known as the Halcyon Domain, which rots in the wake of its Pantheon’s abandonment. Grandiose cities and awe-inspiring cathedrals to the Veiled Gods now crumble slowly into ruin, fallen bastions of the prosperous epoch ruled by the guiding hand of God-King Othedias. Othedias, chosen by the Veiled Gods as the bridge to divinity, conspired with his Grand Ordinants and Aetherlords to enact clandestine machinations that could shift the balance in celestial power, enraging the pantheon. His blasphemy was met with cataclysmic retribution. The gods rained destruction upon the land, ending the Old World and forsaking the surviving peoples of the Halcyon Domain to an existence of growing desolation. The Veiled Gods then abandoned this world in what is referred to as the Apostasy, leaving what remains to wither under ever-growing shadow, the clouded skies growing darker with each passing generation as they herald the world’s slow death march into entropy and oblivion. The cycle of the soul has been sundered, cursing all who live or ever will live with the “soul blight,” a mark upon every mortal ensuring that, upon their death, they will rise again as a corrupted revenant bent on destroying everything they loved in their former life. If their risen body is destroyed, the marked soul withdraws into the dark, ethereal mass known as the Umbra, seeking others to haunt and corrupt. It’s now been nearly a century within the Age of Umbra, and those who remain rebuild what they can among the ruins of the Old World. Referring to themselves as the Enduring, these scattered communities of survivors huddle within reinforced battlements where Sacred Pyres burn as a beacon of hope and safety. All Enduring are trained to survive and defend themselves in this bleak land from a young age, many honed into fierce warriors and Aetherweavers through hardship and necessity by the time they reach adulthood. Bands of hunters brave the cracked and twisted landscape beyond their walls each day to gather sustenance, recover materials, and connect or trade with other surviving settlements. However, many of the outside world’s wandering beasts have mutated from the corruption of the Umbra; this transient storm of twisted souls merges with and contorts the creatures into nightmarish monsters that stalk, rage, and evolve with each newly fused specter. When these monstrosities slay those who confront the wilds, their victims’ blighted souls join the horrors that claimed them. In the absence of the gods, dreams turn ominous and empty, and oracles imagine great alien minds glimpsing into this world, reaching beyond the cosmic veil left unguarded. The diaspora of surviving communities hold against the doom through grit, ingenuity, and faith. Within the swampy flood plains of the mountain-crowned region known as the Idol Hollows, an emergent fort village called Okros has stood resilient against the surrounding swampland dangers for over fifty years. Its massive walls of melted shields and stone encircle the village and central Sacred Pyre, whose flames climb above the tallest ramparts, a burning symbol of strength and safety visible from across the Idol Hollows. A recent seismic event within the valley conjured a massive sinkhole referred to as the Shalk Chasm, uncovering an expanse of long-buried structures and vestiges from before the Old World. Concerned and curious about what boons or banes might await discovery within this subterranean catacomb, brave Enduring slowly investigate the mysteries below, while scouts seek allies from erudite places, such as the Celsians of Amber Reach. Nestled against the Griefcleft Mountains that buttress the eastern edge of the Idol Hollows, dividing it from the tainted jungles of Aveidoora, the glorious city of Amber Reach lays fallen and haunted in the wake of the Apostasy. The once- prosperous capital’s expansive cityscape of overbearing gates, gothic towers, and staggering fortresses lies damaged and derelict, with empty households now sheltering horrors and looters. Within the city’s Ashcall Quarter, the Celsian Athenaeum, a grand college and library repurposed into a stronghold, still holds against the dark. Here, hundreds of Enduring work against the deadly spirits and ghastly killers that torment the city ruins, seeking to reclaim control of Amber Reach’s streets. A rising faction of hedonic, ruthless scoundrels and raiders known as the Damask Queens expand their territory from the far side of the debris-strewn Cinnabar Quarter, their crossings with the Celsians growing more violent with each encounter. As despondent as existence may seem in the Halcyon Domain, within these communities of the Enduring, hope continuously sparks aflame. Whispers speak of remnants of divine power lingering within lost shrines and holy sites that can rebuke the soul blight. Rumors spread between settlements of heroic figures felling greater evils and reclaiming ancient relics for the might of the Enduring. Spirited leaders and champions rouse their fellow Enduring with promises of expanding their walls and avenging their fallen. Zealot factions fervently seek means to commune with the absent gods, forever searching for ways to repent for Othedias’s crimes. Those who can access the Aetherweave see visions of distant sanctums and uncorrupted fanes that cast aside the clouded skies to preserve light and life—or even redeem those touched by the soul blight. Hermetic societies claim to carry tomes and truths of God- King Othedias and his great tragedy, along with prophecies that speak of a chance at salvation for the realm. The lands may be dark, but the points of light burn ever so bright. THE AGE OF UMBRA 281 Chapter 5: The Age of Umbra"

THE AGE OF UMBRA 281 Chapter 5: The Age of Umbra\n-- 282 of 415 --\nCOMMUNITIES All communities are available, but some have unique aspects within an Age of Umbra campaign. As needed, provide the following information to your players and choose one or more of the questions to ask them during your session zero. Highborne and Slyborne Some communities manage to carve out a surviving section of an Old World cityscape, reinforcing barricades and battlements within a deadly urban ruin while enjoying the spoils of sacking the remnants of the past age’s high society. Others were lucky enough to build a new township near a resource-rich location, where those who rose to power could enjoy an uncommon life of comparable luxury. It is in these places that factions of thieves and thugs thrive, whether in the employ of the leadership, or by eroding them from below. Highborne communities within the Age of Umbra are extremely rare, and are often either based on the ghost of an Old World political power or a newly forged tyranny built on recovered or stolen resources. Opulence in these dark times is scarce but hedonistic, reserved for those close to ruling powers and protected with promises of influence or threats of violence. • Who are the leaders of your community, and how close are you to their inner circles to have tasted the finer things in this dire life? • How did you or your bloodline manage to accumulate enough resources or reputation to carve some influence within your community? • Among the upper echelon of your community, who do you trust the most? Who do you trust the least? Slyborne characters are skulkers and thieves who flourish alongside those of influence or wealth across the land. Whether they work for highborne factions that try to maintain power or manipulate them for personal gain, those who know how to remain unnoticed or unexploited excel at seizing opportunities. Many slyborne characters also make a name for themselves as scouts or messengers between settlements, trading in goods or rumors as they go. Others still could be members of roguish communities such as the Damask Queens of the Amber Reach, self-crowned leaders in the lawless echo of bygone power. • You’ve built a rapport with a highborne figure. Who are they, and do you trust them, or are they just an easy mark? • Who among your community have you knowingly cheated, and are they aware? • You were part of a botched job not long ago, and the stain still lingers on your reputation. What happened, and who was at fault? Loreborne and Orderborne Many grandiose cities and centers of higher learning dotted the Halcyon Domain during the prosperous previous age, but these monuments are now ruled by cults of shattered will, overtaken by monstrous entities, or lost to complete ruin. Loreborne and orderborne characters hail from a crumbling bastion of Old World academia, upholding aspects of this lost knowledge within their local community. Consider which facets of the Old World they cling to and, if a character’s community exists within the remains of a major Old World city, which district of that city is important enough for the Enduring to make such a dangerous place home. Loreborne and orderborne communities typically rise within or near ancient libraries, temples, or other dilapidated urban environments where knowledge was once plentiful. Others might have taken up in caverns and hidden places where recovered historical records can be safeguarded and studied. A number of these factions remain obsessed with discovering the truths of the ancient Grand Ordinants and Aetherlords, such as those who claim refuge in the Celsian Athenaeum. • What secret about the Old World have you been entrusted with or discovered alongside your community? • How much of your community still remains? If it has fallen completely, what led to its destruction? • What heirloom of the Old World do you carry with you, and what is its significance to you? • What did you leave behind that still haunts you as you try to sleep? For orderborne characters, players should consider the remnants of the Old World that still guide their character and their people through this ruined landscape, and how (if at all) your ideologies might have changed in the face of a withering world. • What tenets or virtues of your community have changed since the Age of Umbra began? Which tenets do your community hold on to unaltered, even if they no longer apply to this broken world? • Which of your community’s tenets or virtues do you wish to embody and spread across the Halcyon Domain?

THE AGE OF UMBRA 282 Chapter 5: The Age of Umbra\n-- 283 of 415 --\nRidgeborne The mountain ranges of the Halcyon Domain are varied, imposing, and prone to extended cold winds that carve the rock into jagged spires and winding valley clefts. Networks of ancient wood and stone bridges stretch across wide gaps in mountain passes, and the ones that haven’t fallen to weather or time become deeply important and well protected by the nearby ridgeborne communities that maintain them. Hardened and sturdy people forged by the harsh environment, ridgeborne characters might be scouts, hunters, or trade sentinels within their community. Some ridgeborne villages keep vigil over mountainside tombs and sites of Old World knowledge, clinging to ancient oaths that fades more with each generation. • Who is a childhood friend or rival you formed a kinship with? What task had them leave home a year ago, never to be seen again? • What mountain predator’s call fills you with abject fear, and why? • One of your village elders entrusted you with an heirloom. What is it, and what or who did they request you keep it from? Seaborne The scattering of coastal cities that still span the Halcyon Domain’s shores are defined by an existence straddling the dangerous waters of the Ashen Seas and the ever-expanding threat of shadow that corrodes the land. Even so, these communities remain important places of commerce and resources, with mighty fishmongers and sailors battling the masses of deadly threats from under the waves as they sail. Still, seaborne characters are often more carefree than others, taking inspiration from the mercurial nature of their nearby lakes or seas in an otherwise dour world. • What is the one tale you’ve heard about the depths of the sea that still makes you nervous? • When you were younger, you swam deep beneath the waters and encountered something unexpected. What was it, and why does it wander back to your thoughts on occasion? • A traveler once came through your town and said something to you that shook you to your core. What was it, and what do you wish to tell them should you see them again? Underborne Numerous underground societies claimed space within caverns beneath the surface, but only some of these communities have made contact with the surface since the abandonment of the gods. Some cavernous metropolises, now half-buried by crumbling earth, fight to survive against the terrors that stalk the underworld tunnels. Others build anew within the vacant remains of societies of yore, hoping to uncover secrets to better their fortunes. Underborne characters could be scrappy scavengers and tomb delvers who feel at home in lightless, dust-filled spaces away from the tumultuous skies and flying nightmares of the surface world. With the arrival of the Shalk Chasm, some underborne communities might have been exposed to the surface for the first time since the fall of the world. • When you are alone in quiet places, what sound do you believe you hear, and what do you think it means? • You’ve spent much of your upbringing within a reclaimed subterranean structure. What was its original purpose, and what did you discover about it that you’ll never forget? • What is a place beneath your community that everyone knows to avoid at all costs? What happened when you snuck into it when you were younger? Wildborne The natural world beyond any settlement’s walls is as dangerous and dark as it is expansive and beautiful. Sprawling, haunted woodlands filled with deadly, mutated wildlife often hide vibrant glades of natural aether, where bioluminescent flora offers signs of solace or magical protection against the consuming darkness. When a player creates a wildborne character, they should consider how their character’s homeland carved its place of peace among the twisting vines and brambles. Some wildeborne societies of the Old World remain within their ancient fanes to hold hope for a better future, living symbiotically with the rare, uncorrupted pockets of nature. Other wildborne communities stem from lost soldiers or fleeing survivors who the spirits of the wild protect in their time of need. • What landmark within the forest has appeared in your dreams since childhood? What do you think it means? • Which nature spirit does your community rely on the most for protection? What early signs of their corruption are you worried about? • What did you witness within the wilds that makes you fear your home doesn’t have much time left? Wanderborne Many wanderborne communities either flee destruction to start anew elsewhere or uproot themselves frequently for fear of attracting the wilds’ worst horrors. Others might be made up of survivors with common purpose, a life where braving the deadly chaos of the world is also a quest for answers. A wanderborne character might have spent their life on the run due to circumstance or danger, or felt the subtle desperation of the realm and refused to sit still. • Why does your community keep picking up their roots and moving on? What do some fear is following them each time they do? • What is the one place you lived that you quietly wish you could return to? What is there that still holds a place in your heart? • You’ve had a recurring nightmare about a particular location. What about this place frightens you?

As needed, provide the following information to your players. All Ancestries Consider how the harsher setting and environment can intermingle with Daggerheart’s ancestries to inspire dark, weird, and unique interpretations. Clanks Clanks are often carved from stone and iron and were originally developed as vessels for holy spirits and messengers. Many stopped functioning and became statues when the gods left the Halcyon Domain. Ribbets Ribbets are large, often 6 to 8 feet tall, and prefer to skulk on all fours when not leaping or standing still. Drakona In the Halcyon Domain, Drakona are taller and more reptilian in both physicality and proportions. They lean forward as they move, using their tails to balance their weight. Faeries Faeries are more sensitive to the soul blight than other ancestries, causing their physical appearance to develop in jagged and monstrous ways. CLASSES All classes are available, but some have unique aspects within an Age of Umbra campaign. As needed, provide the following information to your players. Bards, Druids, Rogues, Rangers, Sorcerers, and Wizards The forces of spellcraft and magic—especially dark magic— that flow unseen through the world are referred to as the Aetherweave, and those uncommon few who can manipulate it are known collectively as Aetherweavers. This art is difficult to teach to mortals, and they rarely wield it instinctively. With many of these secrets lost with the previous age, the presence of an Aetherweaver is remarkable and often met with awe, fear, and sometimes mistrust. Players who create an Aetherweaver should consider the responsibility they carry with these gifts, and determine how brazenly they use these mystical abilities. Splendor Domain Since the gods’ abandonment and the fall of the Grand Ordinants, the great clerics of old, access to divine powers and healing rituals is a fading art. Many fear the very essence of such magic is dying with the light, so it is not uncommon for some to foist sudden worship and expectation onto those who display such gifts. However, while some see hope, others see those with these abilities as an opportunity to express their hate for the absent gods. Seraphs and wizards who display their Splendor domain abilities or spells might make a profound impact or draw unwanted attention, depending on their current company. Players who create seraphs or wizards should consider how open or guarded their character would be with their abilities. THE AGE OF UMBRA 284 Chapter 5: The Age of Umbra"

Treat Community as a Means of Survival You have grown up in a world of despair, raised to rage against the dying of the light. No matter the differences or challenges between you and others you meet, forging and protecting the bonds of community close and abroad is a goal that surmounts most others. If the Enduring cannot work together, then all truly is lost. Remember That Not All Darkness Is Evil Most of the shadow that plagues this land is born out of tragedy, big and small. Keep in mind that many threats you face have a history—a sad and solemn story—that set them on this terrible path. With the right inquisitiveness and creativity, you can oftentimes parlay with or even redeem what hunts you before resorting to complete destruction. Many lost to the dark still retain some aspects of themselves to appeal to, and rumored magics could hold the key to cleansing elements of the Umbra’s corruption. Embrace Lethality The Age of Umbra is a realm of hardship, challenge, and loss, which allows for momentous revelations and incomparable victories. Still, very few groups of heroes who venture out into the Halcyon Domain carry any of the same faces when their journey is done. Find joy in the risks, relish the opportunities for epic and memorable character deaths, and excitedly create new characters that the others can meet at the next encampment or landmark. Consider Your Role Everyone in this world is driven to survive, whether on their own or as part of a larger group. A character’s backstory can define their previous role in this realm, the relationships they’ve already established, and where they honed their knowledge and skills. For example, your character might have been a hunter, scavenger, philosopher, storyteller, oracle, scoundrel, leader, demagogue, or bandit before the campaign begins.

Relish in the Omnipresent Threat Enjoy setting the scene for each ominous locale beyond the walls of safety, weaving descriptions of solemn colors and the dark beauty of crumbled antiquity with the perpetual sense that nowhere is truly safe. Many things go bump in the night, whether or not the characters are in immediate danger, so be willing to play with shadows, noises, and even monstrous shapes that lumber on the horizon just as your players grow comfortable. When the time comes for a dangerous conflict, exemplify just how harrowing it is with baleful descriptions and menacing energy. Shine Light in the Darkness Often Even as you thrill your players with epic displays of seemingly insurmountable odds, deeply tragic narratives, and an ever- oppressive, gloomy atmosphere, always strive to highlight opportunities for hope, joy, and victory. Be mindful of balancing the starkly terrifying, bleak realm you’re navigating together with scattered locales of untainted beauty, moments of inspiring humanity, and chances to truly make a difference for a better and brighter future. The highest highs leave room for the most memorable lows, and vice versa. Emphasize Compassion Amidst Hardship When society is challenged with facing annihilation, the community often comes together in passionate and wonderful ways. Create and allow room for story moments where the downtrodden and fearful find courage and strength in their fellow survivors and rise to the occasion. Let the people who fight to endure alongside the player characters be vulnerable with them, share their fears and aspirations, forge bonds with the characters, and express why they may invest their future in the characters’ actions. Create Many Goals Across the Many Minds This realm of darkness breeds a plethora of aspirations. The need to survive in a harsh world can forge deeply conflicted and complicated personalities, ranging from the genuinely altruistic to the deeply selfish, and sometimes both. Consider the wide range of communities, factions, and influential NPCs and how they’ve adapted to this dire age. Some may wish to carve a sanctuary for their people, some may embrace the chaos to indulge in their worst impulses, some may place their hopes in uncovering ancient secrets, and some may be driven only by sorrow and vengeance. Everything, even the terrible beasts and malformed fallen that haunt these lands, has a wish and a story that drives them, as futile as some may seem. Build Combat as a Test, a Puzzle, and a Journey There are many deadly and terrifying entities throughout the Halcyon Domain, and sometimes a grand old throwdown to test the characters’ mettle is a thrilling experience for all involved. Even so, much of what is so monstrous in this realm has become so through corruption, guilt, exploitation, or circumstance. Bringing a bit of pathos and humanity to some threats can lead to a deliciously conflicted showdown, and might guide the players to consider other means to victory than just slaughter. Pay some mind to alternative victory conditions that you can tease out through adversary behavior, environmental descriptions, historical recollection, or dialogue. If the players start developing a unique theory on how to cleanse, befriend, or absolve their foe of their violent views in ways you hadn’t accounted for, be open to following the logic and excitement of that narrative thread and ask the players questions that can help you explore that avenue together. 286 Chapter 5: The Age of Umbra"

You can also share it with your players as needed. Eternal Gloom and Volatile Weather Since the Veiled Gods abandoned the world, an endless gloom has engulfed the skies, leaving the nights black as pitch and even the zenith of day a dreary haze. The somber grays of the mist and sky are occasionally broken by heavy rains or strange, erratic weather events, while the more cursed regions are home to never-ending storms of vibrant hues. Some say even underground, cavernous spaces are occasionally host to strange weather phenomena. This gloom only ever breaks over hallowed grounds or on mysterious, unpredictable days, revealing golden sunbeams or gossamer moonlight that grants esoteric boons (or curses) to those present. There are beliefs among the Enduring that the highest mountain peaks can pierce the gloom and offer new homelands free of turmoil. Death Becomes a Curse The places not protected by the Sacred Pyres are vulnerable to the Umbra, the flow of malevolent, unholy spirits that cling to lightless spaces. This amorphous necrotic energy courses through the Halcyon Domain like a dark wind, transient and with unknowable intelligence, as it calls to the souls of the dead like a mother to its children and draws them into its shape. The Umbra is a terrifying force of malice and corruption, a swirling, wailing black mist invoking delirium and despair at its threshold while physically corrupting and transforming the bodies of those that surrender to it. Many of the horrifying monsters prowling these lands have been changed by the Umbra, leaving part of its ever-expanding mass within them like a foul seed, mutating the host and perpetuating its own cancerous expansion through wanton destruction and death. Those who live with the Umbra within them are but a shade of their former selves, taken to extreme emotion and fractured memory. Now twisted into an abominable form and warped with the features of others lost to the Umbra, these victims malevolently lash out at any pinprick of life and light. While whispers spread of those who have been cleansed of the Umbra’s touch, for most they remain just that—whispers. The Rarity of Respite Everywhere the gloom touches, danger lurks. Ancient evils thrive in this age of shadow, while warped spirits marked by the soul blight mingle and corrupt whatever they can subsume. Those who persist must seek the rare, scattered places of safety and respite: where a Sacred Pyre burns. These hallowed fires were lit by the waning conclave of Ordinants before they vanished, and their flames are one of the few wonders that keep the horrors of the Umbra at bay (see the upcoming “Campaign Mechanics” section). The Enduring formed communities around many of these Pyres and kindle them daily for fear of them dying out, while smaller consecrated embers are said to persist undiscovered in distant places, in danger of going cold. But even still, the Enduring must take heed: not all evil is repelled by the Pyres’ flickering light. The Shadow of Society The Old World was one of grandiose castle fortresses, sprawling cityscapes, and imposing temples towering over the lush lands that surrounded them. However, the wrath of the Veiled Gods toppled much of that extravagance to ruin, the kingdoms and cabals that basked in opulence shattered and forgotten. What remains is a ghost of what once was. Surviving remnants of the old ways struggle to reclaim a forgotten glory while most survivors lead grueling lives across the splintered communities of this broken realm. This tattered tapestry of heritage and history is fading with the light, yet the Enduring forge new culture through hardship, determination, and ambition, picking through the debris of what was in hopes of building what will be. Magic Is Suspicious In ancient times, the practice of Aetherweaving was paramount to the Halcyon Domain’s construction and prosperity. Yet, while rune-marked arms and enchanted relics of the Old World are considered boons by the surviving people of the Halcyon Domain, the Aetherweave is believed to be responsible for the wrath of the Veiled Gods, and thus the Age of Umbra. Much of the world is now suffused in dark magic that saturates the wilds, chaotic and corrupting, wielded by those who worship the gloom of the new age or yield entirely to it. The superstitious disdain for spellcraft is pervasive within many communities, with tales of Aetherweaver hubris taught as fables to youth to dissuade them from such temptation. Places that harbor lingering fonts of magic are instinctively shunned and avoided by many. While Aetherweaving can be used to protect and preserve, it is deeply mistrusted in many social circles, leading to confrontation or exile if care is not taken. 287 Chapter 5: The Age of Umbra"

Recently, one of Okros’s hunting bands, led by Huntmaster Evrados (ridgeborne giant, he/him), delved into the Shalk Chasm in search of resources. There, they stumbled upon an eroded, forgotten temple to an obscure Veiled God. The huntmaster was caught by a monster and dragged into the depths of the temple, and though the remaining three hunters sought to find him, a terrible odor forced them to withdraw out of fear and revulsion. When the band returned to the settlement and shared the news, Elder Akadona (wanderborne orc, she/her) and the village speakers debated the best course of action. Their heated dispute was interrupted—by Evrados’s voice screaming for help from beyond the walls of the camp. Though scouts couldn’t see Evrados in the murky swamp, the hunting band left the light of the Pyre to rush to their huntmaster’s aid. The screams mercifully halted for a time. Then the screams broke out again, Evrados’s lament joined by the wails of his hunters. The denizens of Okros are now terrified, the unsettling din heightening their agitation and fear. The shrieking doesn’t change or wane over time, further exemplifying the unearthly nature of their cries. Desperate for an answer, Elder Akadona has gathered the party and requested that they investigate what happened to the huntmaster and his crew, seeking to save them if possible, and end their suffering if not. The gates of the settlement are opened, revealing the forlorn willows and mist-choked wetland valley beyond. The party must investigate the source of these cries for help and attempt to recover Okros’s lost hunters. However, what monster is responsible, and how do they steal the voices of those missing? What is the monster’s connection to the uncovered temple, and if they recoil back into their lair, what dangers lie within? Are Huntmaster Evrados and his team beyond rescue? What other macabre revelations might require reaching out to another settlement? CAMPAIGN MECHANICS The following mechanics are unique to this campaign. The Strength of Hate The Umbra can seep into all manner of beings, twisting them into a malformed mockery of their former selves instilled with preternatural strength. Adversaries and environments in this campaign can gain an additional type called Umbra-Touched. When an adversary is Umbra-Touched, describe how the Umbra has warped their essence and form. All Umbra-Touched adversaries critically succeed on attacks against a PC on a die roll of 19–20. As the PCs gain scars, they themselves become slowly corrupted by the Umbra. When a PC deals damage, they deal extra damage equal to their number of scars. When a PC marks their last Hope slot with a scar, they don’t retire, instead succumbing to the Umbra’s influence and charging forever into the dark to join the terrors that stalk lightless spaces. Fiery Beacons Every surviving settlement within the Halcyon Domain huddles around the relative safety of a Sacred Pyre, a vibrantly burning flame that is sparked by a Blessed Branch and continuously kindled by those given the mantle of Pyrekeeper. Blessed Branches are a rare and hallowed artifact carried as reliquaries by those who wish to expand the reach of the Enduring and found new encampments. If the characters acquire a Blessed Branch, they can reignite an extinguished Sacred Pyre or create a new Sacred Pyre that stands as a bastion of warmth and safety. BLESSED BRANCH An ashen relic from the Old World that carries a splinter of divinity. When ignited, all Enduring present gain 3 Hope, and the flame it emits repels all but the most powerful monsters from its immediate vicinity as long as it burns. Only a bit of kindling must be provided daily to maintain this slow-burning blaze. 288 Chapter 5: The Age of Umbra"

When the party finishes a short or long rest while not in the vicinity of a Sacred Pyre, roll a d12 for the Lurking Darkness and consult the following list: 1–2: Describe how something monstrous found them in the dark. An adversary of the GM’s choice initiates conflict. 3–5: Describe how something terrifying stalks nearby. You gain 2 Fear. 6–9: Describe how the imposing darkness intensifies. You gain a Fear. 10–11: Describe how the characters rest undisturbed. No effect. 12: Describe how the characters stumble upon a hopeful omen. Each PC gains a Hope. With danger ever abounding, those who brave the shadowed wilds can keep watch in hopes of preventing the terrors of the Umbra from finding them. Parties have access to an additional downtime move: Keep Watch: Describe how you stay vigilant against what lurks beyond your camp. When the GM makes a Lurking Darkness roll at the end of downtime, you roll your Hope Die and choose whether to replace their roll with yours. If multiple players choose this move, you can take the highest die roll. Soul Blight If a humanoid NPC or any PC dies, the GM can spend a Fear to immediately raise them as a Shambling Zombie—or 2 Fear to raise them as a Brawny Zombie—who tirelessly seeks to kill everyone they once cared for. Once their zombie form has been destroyed, the victim’s blighted soul withdraws and joins the Umbra. Their features can appear on future Umbra-Touched adversaries. SESSION ZERO QUESTIONS Ask any of these questions to your players, or make your own. • If members of the party hail from different communities, why did they leave, and what called them to this particular settlement? Do their home communities still exist? What rumors and mysteries surrounding or permeating their communities still linger in their minds? • Are any characters burdened with burgeoning oracle sight? If so, what visions have begun to creep into their sleep? • What do your characters see when they stare into the inky void of night too long? • How deadly does the group wish this campaign to be?

By Meguey Baker, Rowan Hall, & Spenser Starke Complexity Rating: ••• THE PITCH Read this section to your players to introduce them to the campaign. Among the ancient ruins of the fallen world, the great walled cities of the Echo Vale sit as bastions of hope in an otherwise hostile land. Utilizing technology powered by a mysterious language that runs through metal threads tethered high above the valley, these citadels insulate their citizens from the Wastes, where autonomous machines roam wild and massive wandering cities scour the land for scrap. But when a malicious virus infects the machine beasts that work alongside the people of the valley, the once-docile creations turn violent. In a Motherboard campaign, you’ll use technology instead of magic as you play extraordinary heroes leaving the safety of the walled cities to travel the Wastes and bring peace to the Vale once more.

The Echo Vale is so named because its people live among the remains—the “echoes”—of a fallen civilization and attempt to use ancient technology for new purposes. In the hundreds of years since the fallen ones’ mysterious annihilation, the steel and concrete of the old world succumbed to the plants and animals of the valley. Grasses grew in the cracks of ancient roads, trees made homes in derelict skyscrapers, and history forgot the names of figures depicted in crumbling statues, leaving those who built homes in the husks of these once-great cities to muddle their way through the powerful programs and machines left behind. Now, formidable settlements such as Argent make home among decaying ruins, building walls to keep violence out and workers in. Meanwhile, Carrowcroft Walkaway and other wandering cities move through the valley on all manner of vehicles, towns atop lumbering machines like travelers hauling their packs. Above the valley lies the Network, a dense web of glimmering metal wire that shepherds information and communication across the disparate cities of the Echo Vale. Though the valley’s inhabitants have long used this ancient technology, the complex language used to create and modify the network was lost when the previous civilization fell. Throughout the Echo Vale roam autonomous machines of the fallen world, called remnants. These automatons come in two primary forms. Some resemble animals, with features that match their living counterparts. Others were designed with a function in mind, such as defenders, builders, watchers, or domestic laborers that carried out tasks alongside their long-dead creators. Some remnants live within cities and are considered “tame,” while others roam “wild” in the Wastes, often territorial and hunting for sources of energy. Some are large enough to hold entire wandering cities on their backs, while others are small creatures that serve no apparent function aside from supplying scrap parts for the working machines people need to use each day. These machines gain energy from a variety of sources. Remnants are drawn to power and information like organic animals to food; while tame remnants can gather theirs from connections to the Networks within cities, their wild counterparts must resort to other means. Remnants can produce energy through photosynthesis, kill other remnants for their power stores, or hunt people to siphon their energy. They act like other wild animals—always focused on their next meal, whatever they must do to get it. Rumors say that some wild remnants are able to harvest information from the brains of the creatures they kill. The Wastes are the overgrown, hostile lands between cities that are filled with wild remnants and ancient ruins. The average citizen spends most of their life within a walled or wandering city, but needs arise that require trips out into the Wastes. City defenders must stop attacks from wild remnants, messengers run between cities when portions of the Network need repair, and some cities rely on hunting parties for food. Out in the Wastes, travelers and remnants alike can still access the Network through free data wells. To access the vast information left behind by the ancient world, inhabitants both mortal and machine use the ports at the base of data wells, slender towers that reach up to the lines of the Network. Data wells can be found across the valley, but many exist within walled cities, rendering them inaccessible to the rest of the region. The wells in the Wastes that remain freely available become hotbeds of violence, as wild remnants use them like a watering hole for power and information. In contrast, the Pilgrims of the Spire are a group known to strongly value and protect free data wells, as they’re considered sacred places connected to the Motherboard.

MOTHERBOARD 291 Chapter 5: Motherboard\n-- 292 of 415 --\nThe tallest spire at the center of the Echo Vale is the Motherboard, from which all threads of the Network originate. Though no one has ever been able to enter this daunting tower, each city has their own beliefs about its ancient power. Most citizens revere the massive presence within as a god, believing it was worshipped by the fallen civilization and carries their wisdom forward to bless today’s information-scarce world. Others believe it is a “master program” the technomancers of the fallen world left behind, and is therefore as fallible as any other remnant. Though the Motherboard herself does not communicate with people directly, she shepherds all data and power through the Network. Without her operating system, the valley’s technology would eventually fail. Despite what is commonly believed, some technomancers and pilgrims claim to speak to the Motherboard in the machine language, known as “kohd.” Technomancers are the datacrafters who utilize ancient machines for new purposes. Historians work to decipher kohd, while practitioners work directly with remnants and other technology to gain a deeper understanding of this arcane language. Some forgo study of kohd entirely in favor of simply utilizing machines for their power. Most have a general understanding of how to employ the effects of the fallen world’s technology, allowing them to operate and control its powerful programs, even without understanding its inner workings. Because this tech isn’t fully understood by the people of the modern age, technomancers can manage only temporary repairs on the remnants. Machinists are more focused on the physical aspects of remnants. Many of them work in factories or scrap works, repairing gears, wires, and processors for a variety of machines, including remnants and mechanicals (operator- driven machines). Some machinists can cobble together new remnants from spare parts, but they must use old remnant cores from the fallen world to give them life. Stories tell of wild remnants creating more of their own kind, but most consider these myths told by travelers. Recently, a disaster occurred known as the Remnant’s Fury—a virus spread through the Network that caused the remnants to attack in the dead of night. These machines, which once worked peacefully in homes and businesses, assailed hundreds of unsuspecting people in both walled and wandering cities. In the Wastes, travelers found themselves suddenly facing particularly violent packs of wild remnants. Autonomous machines have always posed unique dangers— working remnants short out, wild remnants kill for energy— but this was different. This was a massacre. More and more remnants are becoming violent, and those who live under the Network must figure out what to do before the Echo Vale meets a fate like the fallen world. No one knows who or what caused the malicious virus taking hold of the remnants, but for it to be this widespread, there’s growing certainty that it must somehow involve the Motherboard. COMMUNITIES All communities are available, but some have unique aspects within a Motherboard campaign. As needed, provide the following information to your players and choose one or more of the questions to ask them during your session zero. Loreborne Many loreborne communities are devoted to the history of the fallen world and the technology they left behind, whether spiritually or practically. Loreborne characters could be experts in the machine workings of mechanicals or remnants, technomancers attempting to use kohd, or academics studying the history of the fallen civilization. If they have careers in any of these fields, they’ll be highly sought after wherever they go. • You discovered something about the fallen ones you’ve never shared with anyone. What secret do you keep? • You’ve trained as a technomancer for many years, but one thing baffles you about the remnants. What is it? • You have a trick to get any machine up and running.

MOTHERBOARD 292 Chapter 5: Motherboard\n-- 293 of 415 --\nOrderborne In the Echo Vale, most orderborne characters belong to a group focused on protecting a larger community. They might defend a walled or wandering city, or work as contractors hired to hunt and scrap remnants in the Wastes. These characters use their skills for a price—sometimes the benefits are housing, other times scrap parts, or simply profit. Groups associated with a city often have regimented operations, while contractors who travel the valley are more likely to have unique systems and skills. • You were once a member of a small group of contractors, but now you’re stationed in the Argent guard. What made you choose to stay within the walls? • You have a trick for catching and scrapping wild remnants that city officials pay handsomely for. What is it, and who taught it to you? • A loved one was badly injured in an accident during a scrap run. What happened, and why do you feel it was your fault? Ridgeborne The mountains bordering the valley support the spider-like web of the Network, making their peaks neutral territory. All cities are expected to contribute citizens to the Tower Watch, an independent group who tends to the towers and wires and protects the Network from the effects of wildlife and weather. Players might choose the ridgeborne community if they want to build a character who belongs to the Tower Watch or one of the smaller wandering or walled cities that make a home on the cliffs for safety. • Do you consider yourself at home in the lower valley? Why or why not? • There is a secret that only the Tower Watch knows. What is it? • You once saw someone fall from a tower into the Wastes below. What led to this? Wanderborne Wanderborne characters may be worshippers of the Motherboard who identify as Pilgrims of the Spire. These devotees leave the cities to traverse the Wastes, facing wild remnants and violent travelers to reach the central spire. Though the tower is sealed to entrants, other worshippers establish large camps at its base and attempt to connect to the “voice of the Mother.” • You’re certain you once heard the voice of the Motherboard. What did she tell you? • You don’t believe the Motherboard is a god, but you traveled with the Pilgrims anyway. Why? • The Pilgrims of the Spire protect a secret. What is it? Other wanderborne characters are citizens of a roaming city. These civilizations range in size from only a few homes to massive metropolises that move through the Wastes. Wandering cities eschew walls, favoring movement as a means of protection from remnants and other dangers. Some wandering cities are built on mechanicals and must be driven or controlled by people, while others are built on the backs of giant remnants. After the Remnant’s Fury, the wandering cities atop remnants were forced into a dangerous position: if they can’t keep their remnant pacified, they risk losing not just their home, but their entire community. • You were part of the team that cares for your city’s giant remnant. What do you know about its personality that others don’t? • You were training to pilot your wandering city’s mechanical, but you left to live somewhere else. What happened that drove you out? • Your wandering city’s remnant follows the same path through the valley and will not stray from it. Why is this? Underborne The fallen ones not only paved the valley in pliable gray stone, they also dug into the earth and created labyrinthine buildings underground. Underborne characters are likely members of communities that avoid the danger and strife of the valley above in the dark and twisting passages below. These underground cities fiercely protect their few aboveground entry points, but they still face danger from remnants that can dig beneath the earth—in particular, underborne communities are often threatened by old farming remnants operating in the wild. • The buildings that make up your underground community once had a unified purpose. What do you believe this purpose was? • Members of your community have a unique way of dispatching remnants underground. How do they accomplish this? • Your community protects something important.

Clanks Clanks are unavailable in a Motherboard campaign. All autonomous robotic beings are remnants, and though they have many unique forms, none have sapience. Magical Ancestries Some ancestries in Daggerheart have inherent magical features, like the Drakona’s Elemental Breath. Consider how these would manifest in a world where magic comes from technology, then adapt the flavor of each feature accordingly. CLASSES All classes are available, but some have unique aspects within a Motherboard campaign. As needed, provide the following information to your players. All Classes with Spellcasting Rather than magic, characters who use a Spellcasting trait instead utilize technology to carry out their abilities. Some come to technomancy through years of study, while others feel an innate call to the ancient ways. Characters with a spellcasting trait should decide how they utilize technology to mirror spellcraft and consider what tools, processes, or systems they need to accomplish their goals. Sorcerers & Wizards Since magic is technology in this campaign, sorcerers are biohackers that incorporate technology into their physical form, whereas wizards tinker with what they find and combine programs and machines together to build something new. Druids When druids transform into a Beastform, it wraps around them as a mechanized suit that can enhance their senses, change the way they move, or grant them unique abilities. A druid’s Beastform can look similar to the remnants of the Echo Vale or more closely resemble living animals. MOTHERBOARD 294 Chapter 5: Motherboard"

MOTHERBOARD 294 Chapter 5: Motherboard\n-- 295 of 415 --\nBeastbound Rangers In a Motherboard campaign, a Beastbound ranger’s companion can be a living creature, but organic fauna are considered both rare and valuable within the cities. Alternatively, they may have developed a close relationship with a remnant. OPTIONAL RULE: CORRUPTION TRACK If a Beastbound ranger has a remnant companion, they can use the following rules to make the remnant subject to the same threat of corruption from the Remnant’s Fury. Record the following Corruption track on the Companion sheet. At the beginning of downtime, the ranger rolls their Fear Die. If it lands on a 1, they must mark a Corruption and describe the temporary glitch that overcomes their companion. Corruption Track:  Specialized technomancers may be able to temporarily repair the remnant (which clears 1d4 Corruption), but the only way to truly save them is to stop the malicious virus coming from the Motherboard. If the companion’s last Corruption is ever marked, the remnant becomes violent and can no longer be commanded or repaired. The ranger must take a new companion with two new Experiences. They carry over the same number of level-up options they’ve already chosen to this new companion. Seraphs Generally, seraphs worship the Motherboard as their god, kohd as a holy language, and treat the many programs and pieces of technology that come from them as power imparted by their faith. Others believe there are many gods, known as the Faint Divinities, that live within the Network, shifting their presence to different areas across the vale as needed. Players should determine why their character relates to technology on a spiritual level, rather than simply employing it. They should also consider if and how they offer their devotion to the Motherboard or Faint Divinities. Warriors The warrior’s “Combat Training” feature is replaced with the following new feature: Ikonis Training: You start with one Force augment already crafted and installed in your Ikonis.

MOTHERBOARD 295 Chapter 5: Motherboard\n-- 296 of 415 --\nPLAYER PRINCIPLES If your group decides to play this campaign, give your players the following information before character creation. Replace Magic with Technology In a Motherboard campaign, all magic is technology. When your character casts spells, consider how the effect manifests in this world. Each time they use a weapon, consider how to align it with the repurposed and rebuilt technology of the fallen world. • Does your character wear gauntlets with a screen that allows them to scroll through their grimoire? Does their staff crackle with electricity? • How do they store information from the network when they aren’t connected? • Do they have personal or shared devices that can be loaded with a variety of information types? How is this done? Do they use discs, drives, or plugs? Contrast the Technological with the Emotional While the Echo Vale is filled with exciting technologies and unique adaptations, it’s also filled with people experiencing hardship, fear, and love. As your character travels through the valley, fighting remnants and political adversaries, consider how the wider story affects them personally. Each time your character interacts with new people and technology, consider how they feel about them and take action based on their emotional response. • How does your character feel about the power of the Motherboard? • Has your character ever formed a close connection with a remnant? • How does your character’s history influence their interactions with particular cities or individuals? Create a Shared Language The Echo Vale is built atop an ancient society that perished long ago. The lifestyle and language of the fallen ones was incredibly advanced, yet it still remains obscure to the Echo Vale’s modern people. It’s up to you to make a shared lexicon to describe the technology they use, working with the table to determine what your characters do and do not understand about the fallen world. This includes the terminology, application, and meaning of places and objects. Your characters may use a language that developed from the one spoken and written by their predecessors, but they’ll likely have a different understanding of words because they lack necessary context. Similarly, their people might have ascribed meaning and function to objects with an entirely different original purpose. • What items from the old world were made of materials strong enough to survive the test of time? If portions of an object degraded, what remained? • How much of an object’s original function is known to the people? Have they adapted items to a new purpose? • Have they assigned spiritual value to mundane objects? Do they use items that were once culturally significant for mundane tasks? • What words have a different meaning to today’s people than they originally carried in the fallen world?

MOTHERBOARD 296 Chapter 5: Motherboard\n-- 297 of 415 --\nGM PRINCIPLES Keep the following guidance in mind while you GM this campaign. Fill the World with the Ruins of Technology Because the innovation of the fallen ones was so advanced, the people who live in the Echo Vale today have molded their lives around the technology that remains. Even so, they don’t understand it well enough to rebuild the systems that gave the fallen world its immense power. Fill the world with the ruins of state-of-the-art buildings and machines, weather them with centuries of nature’s intrusion, and then describe the less-advanced world built among them. You may also want to decide what led to the downfall of the past civilization, then use that to flavor the world they left behind. • What does the wreckage of a strip mall look like with a small encampment of wooden homes built within? • What particular pieces of technology have people been able to keep running? How have they adapted them? Additionally, you’re encouraged to reflavor Daggerheart adversaries as remnants. • How would an adversary’s abilities manifest if they were made of circuits and steel? How does their appearance change? Do they have different motivations? Make the Details Fantastical and the Conflicts Grounded Though the Echo Vale is filled with fantastical technology that causes large-scale problems, each confrontation should center the struggles of its people, be they cultural, political, or spiritual. Use technology as window dressing for grounded conflict to blend the exciting details of the campaign with personal stakes for each character. You can use the abilities of remnants and the aspects of cities as allegories for the emotional experiences of the party. For example, if a member of the party recently lost a family member, you could introduce them to an NPC in the Wastes who’s protecting a remnant they were raised alongside, despite the fact that its recent corruption has caused it to become violent. • How does the use of technology highlight a conflict between individuals or groups? • What remnants can act as physical representations of emotional turmoil? Pit Tradition Against Progress There are numerous conflicting ideologies among the cities and travelers of the Echo Vale, but most can be distilled into two schools of thought: Some people want to reject their predecessor’s technology, allowing the people of today the chance to define themselves and make their own way in this new world. Others believe they must dig further into the past to harness the powerful machines the fallen world left behind. • How do these opposing viewpoints come into conflict? • How do the political and social conflicts affect characters personally?

Technomancy Imagine trying to explain our modern technology to our distant ancestors—it would seem like magic. This is how technology from the fallen world should be engaged with and described by the people of the Echo Vale. Reading the ancient language of kohd and pressing buttons on screens to perform supernatural feats is impossible without the Network. People who use technology are known as technomancers, and the way they use technology is only limited by your and your players’ imaginations. Consider how this prowess will look for each player character and NPC, allowing the technological to become extraordinary. The Fallen World The fallen ones were a powerful people who developed the very systems that likely destroyed them, but the world they left behind is as rich as it is obscure. The shimmering wire Network overhead, steel skyscrapers, concrete buildings, and machines with their own consciousness fill the Echo Vale even as nature works to reclaim it. Here, rivers pass through cities, buildings fill with new growth, and ancient monitors hang on the wall like panes of shattered glass. Scrap Operations Because the modern world is built on an ancient civilization’s ruins, it relies on the scraps they left behind. Thus, there is a unique economy and set of terms built around the concept of scraps. Scrap operations often begin with the salvagers, those brave enough to venture out into the wastes to unearth ancient technology and hunt remnants for their parts. Those who survive stand to earn considerable commission depending on what they bring back and where they sell it. Some cities only want replacement parts for their remnants, while others search for artifacts of historical significance. Within the cities, scrappers process and sell parts for mechanical repair and technomancy. Scrap shacks are the (often illegal) businesses run by individuals, but some cities require that all machine parts pass through government hands before going to the individual market. Those who work with remnants or practice technomancy might adopt a variety of terms. Mechanists and scrap hackers repair or rebuild machines, autonomous or otherwise, while the technomancers who work with datacraft might be called techs. Quantum Quantum is the currency that runs the Echo Vale’s economy. How much quantum a person has is generally stored on a small black disc that can be inserted into devices throughout the valley. People often decorate and personalize their discs to distinguish them from one another. Network Tethers When wandering cities and travelers want to access the Network in the Wastes, they throw large hooks known as tethers over the wires above, allowing them to charge technology and collect data from any location. Some technomancers can even intercept Network messages using tethers, though this requires specialized knowledge and equipment. Sometimes more ambitious or desperate individuals, known as skimmers, climb up to the lines and use smaller hooks or contraptions to slide along the Network cables, allowing them to gather data and traverse the Wastes from above. Wandering Cities The wandering cities are a true testament to the ingenuity of the people in the Echo Vale. Most cities precariously balance atop a remnant or a specially crafted vehicle piloted by a single driver or team. These vehicles come in all shapes and sizes and very often have collections of smaller crafts that travel with them for hunting, defense, or the general expansion of their populace. CARROWCROFT WALKAWAY This behemoth is one of the largest of its kind, with layers of buildings crowded atop a walking machine and guns jutting out at all angles from its turtle-like form. Recently, Carrowcroft leaders became dissatisfied with sending out small Croft Walkers to pick on less protected towns and travelers, leading them to try something much more ambitious. For decades, the leaders of Carrowcroft have had their sights set on the abundance of technology and scrap behind the walls of Argent. They’ve recently made a number of attacks against the formidable city. The Argent guard has held them off for the time being, but not without considerable loss of life on both sides. Now, with Argent thrown into violence by the Remnant’s Fury, politicians in the walled city worry that the Croft Walkers will come back to attack while they’re vulnerable. There’s even a rumor circulating that Carrowcroft Walkaway somehow infiltrated the Motherboard and initiated the virus, allowing them to harvest scrap from the other settlements in the valley one by one. As they use only operator-driven mechanicals, they have a considerable advantage until someone can access the Motherboard to understand the cause. There’s also a rumor in the Wastes that, though Carrowcroft doesn’t use remnants for labor, they are harvesting their cores to use in unique ways no other technomancers have been able to before.

MOTHERBOARD 298 Chapter 5: Motherboard\n-- 299 of 415 --\nMOTHERBOARD OTHER WANDERING CITIES You can populate the Echo Vale with the wandering cities below or create your own. The May Trader Caravan: A collection of smaller vehicles, this ragtag group travels the Wastes together hunting wild remnants for scrap and trading with anyone with quantum or a rare piece of technology from the fallen world. May Traders are considered especially brave, as they don’t use walls or a tall walker to keep them safe from remnants. Their caravan is a collection of mechanicals mechanicals that sit low to the ground, and they sacrifice strong defenses for speed and maneuverability. The Library: Built atop a large, spider-like remnant, the Library is a prime example of the insular nature of many valley cities, wandering or walled. Those who live here aren’t interested in adapting and developing new technologies as much as protecting items and information from the fallen world. Nereidus: A long, centipede-like ship with hundreds of oars that snakes through the water off the coast of the Echo Vale. Those who live here share a very communal way of life. Instead of having one leader, they elect a new Mouth of the People each season. Walled Cities Most stationary cities in the Echo Vale were built into ancient ruins, with new walls constructed around their borders to protect citizens from remnants and raiders. Some cities also use geographical formations and ancient structures for defense, while others are rapidly developing innovative defense systems. ARGENT Argent has long been the target of attention across the valley. With the most well-preserved ancient skyscrapers, the best fortifications, and the largest collection of tame remnants in the Echo Vale, this heavily stratified city is also a bastion of wealth. Their strictly regimented guard protects the streets and borders, and their prison labor system keeps government scrap operations working twenty-four hours a day. In the wake of the Remnant’s Fury, the leader of Argent, known as the Priv, sent messengers to all walled cities within the valley to try to unify and uncover a solution. There’s talk that they will organize and attempt to enter the tower of the Motherboard, but this would violate many of the most devout orders of the Vale. OTHER WALLED CITIES You can populate the Echo Vale with the walled cities below or create your own. Calcarus: This city consists of a single ancient skyscraper, now filled with its own small forest. Its citizens have grafted numerous wooden buildings onto the tower’s exterior, using Calcarus’s height to keep themselves safe from remnants. The Northern Oracle: The site of many pilgrimages, this small village hosts a massive amphitheater filled with screens. The High Oracle claims she can use the screens to speak to the Motherboard, but only her most devout followers have ever claimed to see it. Switch Withawick: This city is entirely underground, and its citizens’ eyes are sensitive to light because the people rarely come up to the surface. There are two prominent rumors about the Switch: that its citizens are cannibals (unlikely), and that they know how to create new remnant consciousnesses (possible). Designing a City When you design your own wandering or walled city, you can start with the following questions: • Does this city wander? If so, what is it built on? If not, what do its walls or fortifications look like? • What does this place look like? What architectural elements are from the fallen world? What portions are new? • In what unique ways have the people used fallen world scraps and technologies? • How do the citizens feel about remnants? The Motherboard? • What cultural custom is unique to this city? • What do these people want that they don’t have? What do they have to offer others in trade? 299 Chapter 5: Motherboard"

After the outbreak of the Remnant’s Fury, Argent’s city guard scrambled to subdue the violent machines. But wave after wave succumbed to the malicious virus, and politicians grew more desperate to avoid widespread fear. Priv Maelor Rhodek (orderborne elf, she/her), the city’s charismatic leader, sent a messenger to assemble a team that has the skill and experience to handle remnants, go undercover as civilians in the machinists’ Build Sector, and figure out what’s causing the remnant attacks. Priv Rhodek gives her word that any scrap the party acquires while protecting the city is theirs to keep. In return, she asks that they collect as many remnant cores as possible so she can pass them to her technomancers to diagnose the cause of the violence. She also gives the party the name of a surprising contact to see before they head into the scrap factory where many attacks have occurred. The contact is Mac the Scrap Jack (wanderborne faun, he/him), who runs an illegal scrap operation, making him an unlikely friend for the very person that outlaws his work. But on the Priv’s word, he gives the party a Hotspot. This illegal device can be carried as a backpack and, when set down and activated, it stalls out nearby remnants for a few moments, allowing the party to get out of a bind. He also gives the party an offer: save one of the remnant cores they recover and bring it to him instead of Rhodek. He’ll pay them a few quantum, and they’ll have the opportunity to look at the data from the core to try and see what’s “causing all this ruckus with the rems.” As they fight their way through the factory, does the party have compassion for the once-tame remnants, or do they dispose of them indiscriminately? Will the players try to talk to the factory workers to learn more about the Remnant’s Fury, or will they operate like a cleanup crew, keep their eye on the scrap they stand to gain? Will they bring the Priv all the remnant cores they collect, or will they save one for Mac and risk trouble from the city guard? If they perform well, will Priv Rhodek tell the party more about the Remnant’s Fury and the involvement of the Motherboard? FOR THE GM As the party defeats violent remnants within the factory, provide each PC one remnant core alongside the scrap they would normally obtain from their battles (see the upcoming “Crafting & Trading” section). The following item description explains the Hotspot’s mechanics and lists the scrap requirements to craft a new one.

Tech Damage In a Motherboard campaign, magic damage is instead called tech damage. This damage is caused by technomancy; it might be a piercing shrill, a concussive blast, a blinding flash, swarming nanobots, a drone emitting a high-powered plasma beam, or anything other product of supremely advanced technology. Ikonis & Other Tools The following sections detail how weapons, armor, and other technology are used in a Motherboard campaign. IKONIS Characters don’t have access to Daggerheart’s normal selection of primary and secondary weapons during this campaign. Instead, characters receive a personalized weapon known as an Ikonis, a special weapon given to citizens of the Echo Vale when they come of age. It starts as a simple rod of metal and is designed to receive modifications as the bearer ages, shaped according to their needs. It can evolve to become many types of weapons—a staff with webs of colorful wire wrapped around its hilt, an ornate bow humming with energy, a heavy hammer designed for the forge, a spear with knobs and triggers that allow for different attachments, or anything else that might suit the wielder. Players will design their character’s Ikonis using the Motherboard module sheet (available in the appendix or at www.daggerheart.com/downloads). Each player should take a copy of the module and slide it under the right side of their character sheet. Then, they will make selections about trait, range, and damage in the top section of the module, then make up a name and description for their weapon. Finally, they’ll record the weapon’s details in the Primary Weapon slot of their character sheet. Ikonis are always considered to be two-handed weapons and start with the “Bonded” feature: Bonded: Gain a bonus to your damage rolls equal to your level. AUGMENTS Ikonis also allow PCs to install augments. A character’s Ikonis starts with two Augment slots at Tier 1, showing that it has evolved from its most basic form, and it gains an additional slot at each subsequent tier. Augments can be crafted as a downtime move when PCs have the scrap to do so. (See the upcoming “Crafting & Trading” section for more information.) An Ikonis starts with no augments installed. A character may build as many augments as they’d like, but they can only install a number equal to the Augment slots they have available. For example, even if a level 1 PC has three augments built, they can only install two on their Ikonis at a time. When they progress to level 2 (and they become a Tier 2 PC), they can have all three augments installed. While installed, augments are treated as additional features for that weapon. PCs may freely swap augments they’ve already crafted during downtime. The Motherboard character sheet module includes a selection of base augments for PCs to choose from, but GMs are encouraged to make more to offer their players as well, using the provided options as a template. ARMOR Characters have access to Daggerheart’s normal selection of armor, but should flavor it to their preference within the campaign setting. NETWORK TETHER Each PC adds a Network tether to their inventory at character creation. Tethers are typically large hooks attached to a data cable. These allow travelers to toss the hook onto an overhead wire to charge their technology and gain access to the Network while moving through the Wastes. PCs must have access to the Network, via a tether or other means, to perform downtime moves. MOTHERBOARD 301 Chapter 5: Motherboard"

MOTHERBOARD 301 Chapter 5: Motherboard\n-- 302 of 415 --\nCrafting & Trading In this campaign frame, gold is not used as a currency. Instead, PCs can gather scrap to trade for a currency known as quantum. The Motherboard character sheet module helps to track their current scrap, along with how much quantum they have to spend. All PCs start with 5 quantum. The Quantum Economy Use the following conversion for Daggerheart when pricing other goods and services using quantum. 10 quantum = 1 handful of gold 100 quantum = 1 bag of gold 1000 quantum = 1 chest of gold Gathering Scrap When the PCs defeat remnant adversaries, they can collect scrap after the combat. There are three categories of scrap, each with an associated die size: Shards (d6), Metals (d8), and Components (d10). When the PCs are collecting scrap, determine which categories of scrap and how many of each (which determines the number of dice they roll) they can find. Each player individually rolls the dice you determine, and the result of each die is compared to the associated scrap category table, listed here and on the Motherboard character sheet module, to determine what scrap a character receives. If a rolled result falls between two values, select the lower numbered option. A character receives one piece of scrap per die, which is recorded on the line next to that kind of scrap on the character sheet module. Tip: Think of the numbers on the roll table as thresholds; when you reach that threshold, you get that scrap. SCRAP CATEGORY TABLES Shards (d6) 1 2 3 4 5 6 Gear Coil Wire Trigger Lens Crystal Metals (d8) 1 3 5 6 7 8 Aluminum Copper Cobalt Silver Platinum Gold Components (d10) 1 3 6 8 9 10 Fuse Circuit Disc Relay Capacitor Battery Example: After a standard fight with some remnants, the GM tells the players to each roll two dice for Shards, two dice for Metals, and a die for Components. The first player rolls a 2 and a 4 for Shards, gaining a coil and a trigger. They roll a 5 and a 7 for Metals and gain a cobalt and a platinum. Finally, they roll a 9 for components and gain a capacitor. The second player rolls a 1 and a 6 for Shards, 3 and 6 for Metals, and a 5 for Components. They gain a gear, crystal, copper, silver, and circuit. MOTHERBOARD 302 Chapter 5: Motherboard"

These are unique pieces of scrap only found on specific remnant adversaries. When PCs defeat a particularly important or powerful remnant adversary, you might grant them each a Relic along with scrap from the table above. These relics should be customized based on the adversary, such as steelhorn of the stag, lens of the flickering falcon, jaw piston of the cryodrake, or gold scales of the scrappersnap. Relics are worth 20 quantum and are often used to craft powerful augments. You should also provide opportunities for PCs to seek specific Shard, Metal, or Component rewards, whether that be through NPC contracts, hunting down particular adversaries, exploring certain areas, or through scrap shacks. Tip: The values on the Scrap Reward Table above are designed for a campaign of around 50 sessions, with 1-2 fights per session. If you plan to do a shorter or longer campaign, adjust your rewards accordingly. Crafting with Scrap The characters can use their collected scrap to craft augments for their Ikonis and other items. When they have enough scrap to build an augment, they can use a downtime move and spend the appropriate amount of scrap. When an augment calls for a generic Relic, a PC can spend any Relic they have. Some augments have prerequisites called precompiles. When this precompile is met, the augment is available to be crafted. The base augments have precompiles that require a PC to be in a certain tier, but a precompile can be anything: a certain value for the PC’s Strength or Evasion, a specific domain or class, or anything else you’d like. Augments can always be broken back into their scrap for parts as needed. You’re also encouraged to give PCs additional tasks or challenges that utilize scrap, such as building a specific machine for a task or collecting scrap for an ally who’s trying to repair a remnant. Selling Scrap for Quantum Local scrap shacks in each city generally trade scrap for quantum and quantum for scrap. By default, each piece of scrap is worth its value on the previous roll table (whether players are buying or selling), and each shop has a daily stock equal to 1d10 of each Shard, 1d8 of each Metal, and 1d6 of each Component. When PCs want to buy a certain type of scrap, roll to determine how many are in stock. These values can always change at your discretion. Example: A PC wants to sell Components at a local scrap shack: 2 circuits and 1 battery. Because circuits are worth 3 quantum each and batteries are worth 10, they would get 6 quantum for the circuits and 10 quantum for the battery, for a total of 16 quantum. They also want to sell some Shards: 2 lenses and 6 springs. Each lens is worth 5 quantum and each spring is worth 2, earning them an additional 22 quantum. They now have 38 quantum. They need to buy 1 crystal and 4 silver to craft an augment. The GM says the scrap shack has enough in stock, so they pay 6 for the crystal and 12 for the silver for a total of 18 quantum. They leave the shack with 20 quantum, 1 crystal, and 4 silver. MOTHERBOARD 303 Chapter 5: Motherboard"

MOTHERBOARD 303 Chapter 5: Motherboard\n-- 304 of 415 --\nWRITING IN KOHD Language designed by Chris Willett Kohd, the language of the fallen world’s technology, has long been a mystery to the people of the Echo Vale. If you’d like to give your players the opportunity to learn how to decipher and write in it over the course of a campaign, you’re encouraged to use this language. We recommend delivering them messages early on from the Motherboard that they can’t read, having technomancers reveal pieces of the language to them as they progress through the story, and then finally giving them the tools to read and write the full language by the climax. SUBROUTINE 1. NODAL WORD GLYPH CONSTRUCTION Example Word - MOTHERBOARD An individual language unit (word) has no discrete letters. Kohd is based on nine nodes, each representing 3 letters (other than the YZ node). Each word is a circuit that flows from Charge to Ground. MOTHERBOARD Construction Step 1 To begin making the word Motherboard, draw a single node (the circle) and connect the charge indicator (the line). This is called the charge node and indicates where the word begins. Take note of the position of the charge node for the word you are writing relative to the other nodes. Both M and O are in the center node. Construction Step 2 Locate the second node for the next letter in the word. In this case, T is down and left. Add a trace line to connect the circuit between the charge node and the new node. Every trace line runs from a source node to an end node. Period PUNCTUATION Connects to final Ground (other than comma) This is placed in an unused corner of a diagram if the position of letters is vague. ARTICLES Live in starting node for their word Comma (Circuit continues) Exclamation Point Question Mark The (definite article) A (indefinite article) Unique/there exists exactly one There is/there exists If If/then So/thus/causing Because/since And Or True/is False/not Ground (word end) Null (*The example above is not needed.)

Charge (word start) ABC JKL STU DEF MNO VWX GHI PQR YZ 304 Chapter 5: Motherboard\n-- 305 of 415 --\nConstruction Step 3 The source node has the letter M in its first position, N in its second, and O in its third. For M, add one subnode (the dot) to the trace line, and for O, add three subnodes. subnodes for O subnode for M T is in the second position on its node, so as we connect the trace line to the node containing H, we add two subnodes. M, O T H Continuing, we can get all the way to MOTHERB. At that point, if we were to connect the trace to the MNO node, the order of letters would become vague. To keep this from happening, draw a ring around or within the MNO node and connect the trace line to that ring. Continue on, adding trace lines, subnodes, and node rings as needed until you reach the last letter of the word. Construction Step 4 Lastly, add the ground indicator to place the last subnode and terminate the trace. Construction Step 5 Constructed words sometimes include too few nodes, so their orientation on the nine-node grid is vague. For example, words like felled, mount, and homing require just two diagonal nodes. In these cases, we add a null modifier to a remote corner of the glyph to indicate the relative position of the nodes involved in the word.

SENTENCE CONSTRUCTION Our example for this subroutine will be this sentence: The network carries communication from city to city. A few of these words in kohd have simplified, non-nodally constructed forms, such as “the” and “from/to.” Refer to the following lexicon for a full breakdown of these words: Construction Step 1 First, we signify the beginning of a sentence with a coupler, a complex series of solder points where the kohders could fuse one sentence circuit to another. An example of a coupler can be seen here; there is no significance to the various lengths in its bars. Construction Step 3 Apply articles. In this case, only Network needs to be modified with an article, which slots into the charge node. Construction Step 2 Next, lay out all nodally constructed words in a line in order. Ignore any words with a shortened version in the lexicon. Construction Step 4 Add words from the lexicon. Note here that from-to replaces two words, not just one. Like if-then, it goes between two glyphs, changing it from “from city to city” to “city from-to city.” Small words from the lexicon can go anywhere they fit.

Designed by Carlos Cisco, Rowan Hall, Spenser Starke, & Mike Underwood Complexity Rating: •••• THE PITCH Read this section to your players to introduce them to the campaign. The Drylands were a place that put the old stories aside. While superstitious miners have long said that the crystals growing wild in this desert are made from the very life-essence of Forgotten Gods, the folk around here had real work to do, and actual deities were left for campfire stories. That is, until a massive colossus answered the call of something ancient and apocalyptic, rising from the earth and devastating the lands. The bold prospectors, tired laborers, and born-again worshippers in the dusty town of Wyllin’s Gulch were thrown from their routine of industry and exploitation, forced to raise scattered armies and watch them die to the behemoth’s strength. And this is only the first of many titanic beasts poised to terrorize the land. In a Colossus of the Drylands campaign, you’ll play a heroic posse of mavericks who must save their home from a legion of colossi and a primordial god seeking vengeance.

The Prophecy of the Drylands God begins as thus: In the center of the world there is a mountain, and deep beneath that mountain there is an ancient and terrible god—a Forgotten God—struggling to break free of his confinement. One day Kudamat, the First Doom will escape his earthen tomb with the help of his nine colossi, the Children of Godfell, to sunder the world, his hated prison, and tear down the sky like fabric. As the New Gods fall from the Hallows Above, Kudamat will slay them with his stone sickle that their blood will flood the Mortal Realm. In this sanguine tide, Kudamat and the new generation of colossi, each made from the god’s very being, will destroy the creatures of the Mortal Realm and make room for abhorrent creations to repopulate the land, sea, and sky. In his triumph, Kudamat will free the many trapped gods of his generation and become the high lord among all divinities. At least, that’s how the old story went. Most people believed it was just another tall tale of the Drylands. The History of the Gods is a myth known by many and believed by few: When the Forgotten Gods built the Mortal Realm in the Earliest Age, they made a place of joys and sorrows, freedom and labor. All the creatures of the land, sea, and sky worked for the many gods and enjoyed the spoils and trials of deities that had nothing but time and endless curiosity. These immortals could not fathom that the New Gods would one day rise and overthrow them in a violent battle, tossing them from their place in the high Hallows Above and entrapping them in the Mortal Realm and the Circles Below. Many Forgotten Gods imprisoned in the Mortal Realm were trapped within the ground, buried over the centuries beneath the rise and fall of civilizations. The deific essence of these gods bleeds from their lasting wounds—and whether this enervation was intentional or not, their power seeped into the earth where they’re entombed, running like veins of stone up to the surface. The crystal born from these veins is known as “essentia,” and all magic in the Mortal Realm comes from its power. As such, there’s a mad scramble for any opportunity to harvest this precious resource, and in the eyes of those in power, land with a vein of essentia is worth the millions of lives sacrificed to the mines built to dig the crystals up. Godfell Mountain is one such land. Sitting in the middle of a crowd of high mesas, amid arid countryside peppered by meager lakes and sparse forests, this peak marks the richest essentia mines on the continent. Though it’s not the center of the world as the stories say, it’s the hub of a region filled with newfound wealth, industry, and an ever-expanding network of dusty towns run by crooked sheriffs. The numerous veins of essentia running from Godfell Mountain come from the power of Kudamat, the First Doom, a Forgotten God seeking freedom and the destruction of the entire Mortal Realm. As these makeshift towns follow the veins of crystal ever closer to Godfell, they move toward the blighted earth the New Gods left to keep mortals from the prison of the ancient god. This mountain is a desolate and dangerous place where few can survive, but that doesn’t stop powerful mining operations and bold prospectors from trying their luck. Kudamat was trapped within Godfell Mountain, or rather, the mountain was formed around him when the Forgotten Gods lost to the New Gods at the end of the Earliest Age. Ever since, like many of his kind, Kudamat was forced to wait for the day he could finally break free. But it wasn’t a simple burial the New Gods performed. To trap the First Doom, the usurper gods split part of his being into nine pieces and tasked nine mortals with hiding the soul shards so Kudamat could not reach his full power. But they should not have given such a paramount task to mere mortals. The nine riders took the shards as far from the mountain as they could manage and buried them in the arid earth, but it wasn’t far enough. Over the centuries, Kudamat reached out through the dirt and stone, veins of crystalline essentia stretching out like tendrils to find his missing pieces. Over time, the godly strife of the Earliest Age and the hidden resting places of the soul shards drifted out of memory and into stories and legends. Legends most sensible folk ignored or forgot. When Kudamat found the first piece of his soul, he began channeling its power to restore his godhood, and a single thundering quake tore a fissure through the center street of Wyllin’s Gulch—a terrible earthquake, they believed, not understanding the apocalyptic toll ringing out across the sands. Kudamat then used a fragment of his divine might to craft a colossus and droves of accompanying aberrations that would guard the soul shard while he siphons the remainder of his power and seeks out the other eight shards. Even with only the barest portion of his power restored, Kudamat’s reawakening is all but inevitable. He grows stronger by the day, searching out the remaining pieces and building more colossi to guard them. If left unchecked, he will reclaim the power of all nine shards and break his earthen shackles, rising again to bring doom to this world. Preacher Rayos (he/him) was the first, or perhaps only the loudest, to recognize the rise of the colossus outside Wyllin’s Gulch as the first step in the Prophecy of the Drylands God. He proclaimed the story of Kudamat, warning people of the increased dangers of the god’s charged essentia. Above all else, he stressed the importance of finding the soul shards and keeping the god from siphoning them. To get the word out, he took his flock from their home in the Left Luck Outpost to Wyllin’s Gulch, the unofficial capital of the western line, where he continues to preach, growing more popular with each passing day. He already had enough of a following in his community—and now times are apocalyptic enough that people are eager for a spiritual leader.

COLOSSUS OF THE DRYLANDS 309 Chapter 5: Colossus of the Drylands\n-- 310 of 415 --\nWyllin’s Gulch worships no gods but the earning and spending of gold, and it will take more than a violent colossus to get the people of this town to pay attention to an ancient prophecy. In the early days of the Essentia Rush, roughly 40 years ago, the Gulch was established as the first western outpost in the region surrounding Godfell Mountain, just a few miles from a rich vein of essentia. As more and more of the crystals were unearthed, powerful moguls established processing plants to speed up the time between mine and money. Belching factories were built up the sides of the Twin Turtles, two great mesas that bordered the burgeoning town, their massive conveyor lifts hauling tons of essentia to the manufactories that process the crystals into the conductive batteries most folk use to power their homes, weapons, and all manner of magical items. Today, with its natural fortifications and wealthy elite, Wyllin’s Gulch is the gatekeeper for anyone approaching Godfell Mountain on the western train line. As such, the townspeople either work mining and processing essentia or host money traps that appeal to new fools who come to try their hand at prospecting the crystals. A wide variety of folks inhabit Wyllin’s Gulch. The arid plains, breathtaking skies, and the possibility of boundless riches attract all types. Living away from the prying eye of larger law enforcement is another perk—while there are sheriffs in Wyllin’s Gulch, they’re paid to protect the mines and manufacturing rather than uphold any version of “justice.” It’s common for outlaw gangs to seek their fortunes by stealing the valuable crystals, while others, who see these mining operations as anathema, destroy the equipment that tears essentia from the ground. But most outlaws find greater success at the smaller essentia outposts than this bastion of dusty fortitude. Essentia outposts range in size from a small collection of tents to a thriving town. Some outposts are formed when just a few folks get together to mine the same vein or sift the same river. Others are created when a company purchases a parcel of land containing a vein and installs a small settlement of workers. Still others are larger towns built by people wanting a bit of community along with their work. Though essentia outposts can vary in size, style, and operating procedure, one thing is always true: where there is an outpost around Godfell Mountain, there’s a vein of essentia. Now, these outposts face the coming threat of more colossi rising from the earth as Kudamat locates his soul shards and uses the essentia veins to siphon back his power. COMMUNITIES All communities are available, but some have unique aspects within a Colossus of the Drylands campaign. As needed, provide the following information to your players and choose one or more of the questions to ask them during your session zero. Loreborne In the Drylands, many folks hold fervent beliefs about the Forgotten Gods, the New Gods, and the essentia crystals that power the world. Loreborne communities take a more scholarly, possibly even evangelical, approach to these beliefs. Some follow the “forgotten ways” and utilize raw essentia in their spiritual practice, while others abstain from essentia entirely, believing it’s a profanity to the New Gods they worship. • What were you taught about the origins of the Mortal Realm, and how did the colossi emerging affect that worldview? • Kudamat’s impending return changed the beliefs of many, but not you. What did you experience in the past that makes your faith unshakeable? • You refuse to use the magic of essentia because you follow the “new ways.” How has your devotion to the New Gods helped you? How has it hindered you? Orderborne Some orderborne characters come from the law. Whether sheriff or deputy, these individuals are often seen as the most powerful members of their town. Though these officers are usually in the pocket of rich essentia mine moguls, if not fully on the payroll, they’re often the most prepared to protect civilians in times of danger. Other orderborne communities are organized bands of outlaws—some who steal and sabotage essentia outposts with a moral goal in mind, and others who just need crystals to sell or power their own magic. Either way, they always operate by a code, unique as it may be. • What incident during your time working for the sheriff prepared you to help panicking civilians worried about the colossus? • You and your posse have killed to get what you need. What rules do you have about who you’ll never harm? • You once took a bribe to do something you regret. What happened, and what was your reward?

COLOSSUS OF THE DRYLANDS 310 Chapter 5: Colossus of the Drylands\n-- 311 of 415 --\nHighborne In the Drylands, most true highborne folk come from elsewhere, seeking to further enrich themselves using the industries surrounding essentia. Some were born into wealth, while others are fallen business owners forced to move out to the desert for their “next big venture.” Regardless of how highborne characters originally found fortune, they often find themselves at odds with the beating sun and the clinging dust, though they have employees to do any task that could even vaguely be classified as “work.” The grand myth that keeps people prospecting is that anyone can find an essentia vein or river deposit and change their lives with riches untold. Though some have done it, they’re few and far between. Most earn enough to keep on working for another day, and a few live comfortably with a little to spare. • What disaster befell your family’s fortune that precipitated your move to the Drylands? • What local custom or practice do you find refreshing that people from home would balk at? • How has your lineage, title, or other highborne affectations gotten you in trouble in the Drylands? Ridgeborne and Underborne In this region of mountains, mines, high deserts, and sparse greenery, both ridgeborne and underborne communities thrive. Ridgeborne characters could come from small outposts, family encampments, or other groups that make home atop the dangerous crags of the region. Some of these communities may even be bold enough to live where others will not—on Godfell Mountain. Though it is dangerous, desolate, and blighted, the mountain yields the richest essentia for those willing to risk everything. An underborne character could be part of a community that took to old essentia mines for refuge, building homes in the darkness beneath the earth. Others are essentia miners who create small underborne communities with fellow members of their profession who spend most of their life excavating the crystals from the stone. This is one of the most dangerous yet common jobs in the region, and it makes for a hardy lot. Whether a character grew up in a Drylands outpost or moved to one to prospect, there are more than enough communities peppered throughout the Drylands that any of these places could be called home. • You were born in the mountains and mesas of the Drylands. What do you know about this land that new prospectors will never understand? • You are afraid of the dark, but venture into the mines every day anyway. What keeps you going back? • You once found something unexpected near Godfell Mountain. What was it, and who did you tell about your discovery? Slyborne With its untold veins of essentia bringing folks seeking to make their fortune from the earth, the Drylands also appeal to people seeking to make their fortune from the exploitation of others. There’s no small share of bad actors who want to get rich and get out quick, either by selling useless parcels of land, shilling water-and-vinegar “snake oil,” or outright theft. But some slyborne communities are more interested in stopping major operations from stripping essentia from the desert than robbing the innocent. The “Harlan Family,” a small but active posse of thieves led by Trace Harlan (they/them), works out of Wyllin’s Gulch for one purpose: to stop ambitious tycoons from mining and producing essentia batteries. They hope to one day tear the factories from the walls of the mesa and drive out the greedy moguls that put profit over people. • What darkness in your past did you attempt to leave behind when coming to the Drylands? • You once betrayed a close accomplice. What happened and why haven’t you spoken since the incident? • You had to go through a terrifying initiation to join your posse. What did you do, and how has it changed you forever? Wanderborne Wanderborne characters are just as likely to originate from within the region as arrive from elsewhere. As most things in the Drylands do, their wanderings gravitate toward the essentia veins. Some wanderborne communities are as old as Godfell Mountain itself, and they have stores of essentia they visit across the desert. Others are new groups of unprepared prospectors who are more likely to die by sun or snake than find any ease in the Drylands. • What common practice of outpost living do you find utterly baffling or uncomfortable? • You have a small cache of emergency items hidden in the desert. What did you hide? • You used to live in an outpost, but something terrible happened that caused you to leave. What happened, and why will you never return?

As needed, provide the following information to your players. All Ancestries Many folks of all ancestries profess to feel the presence of essentia in the ground—especially while Kudamat is using it to siphon back his power. No one can prove if this is true or not, but many use these claims to get high-paying positions working for mining operations. Clanks Clanks are powered by essentia. If a player creates a clank, they should consider how their character regularly obtains this resource and what happens if they’re unable to get enough. Infernis Players who have chosen the Infernis ancestry should consider how their character’s relationship with their heritage from the demons of the Circles Below plays into the various faiths of the Drylands. Fungril, Galapa, and Ribbets Fungril, galapa, and ribbets native to the Drylands are most often well adapted to the desert, but those who aren’t from these deserts commonly live near the few lakes in the region or devise systems to travel with large amounts of water. CLASSES All classes are available, but some have unique aspects within a Colossus of the Drylands campaign. As needed, provide the following information to your players. Druids Druids in the Drylands are more equipped than many to navigate the inhospitable environment. They’re familiar with the unique qualities of desert flora and fauna, and their spells and abilities reflect that. Rangers Many rangers in the Drylands are “lone riders” who prefer only the company of their mount and ride from outpost to outpost, never stopping for long. They’re often defenders of the weak who stand up against local law enforcement when deputies push people around. Seraphs Many seraphs have strong relationships with their faith, either worshiping the Forgotten Gods (such as Kudamat) or the New Gods. This also affects their relationship with the use of essentia—the former utilize the crystals prolifically, while the latter may have a fraught relationship with magic. When playing a seraph, players should consider how their character feels about magic, as well as the way their character engages with their faith within the community. Many choose to become preachers, healers, and prophets of the land. Syndicate Rogue These rogues often operate as deputies, mining operation overseers, or members of outlaw posses. Though any of these groups might work publicly, it takes a master of charm and negotiation, as well as clandestine activity, to accomplish the organization’s more covert goals.

Embrace the Drylands When building your character, consider how their place in the Drylands impacts their aesthetics and approach to the world. Find reasons for them to love the land despite its harshness as they work desperately to protect the region from the monsters trying to tear it asunder. Face the Unstoppable In this campaign, your character stands against creatures taller than the largest buildings, whose destructive power is only matched by the most devastating natural disasters. Decide what makes your character particularly equipped to destroy colossi and, more importantly, what’s personally at stake for them should they fail. Navigate Your Faith The Drylands are a land of extremes: it’s extremely hot, extremely harsh, and extremely easy to die. Folks approach religion the same way. Some people believe that the gods never existed and the stories about the origins of essentia are just marketing and grandstanding. Others continue to worship the Forgotten Gods, attributing a spiritual aspect to their use of essentia. Still others believe essentia is a profanity and commit crimes to close up the mines in the name of the New Gods. Consider the beliefs your character held before the rise of first colossus and how they might have changed since. Ride Like the Wind Just about everyone born in the Drylands can ride a mount from the moment they can walk, and newcomers are expected to learn quickly. Unless you choose a feature for your character that provides an animal companion or applicable spell with benefits, their mount will not change their mechanics or give them an advantage in combat. They can, however, use their mount to pass between towns and portions of the desert with added ease and speed. The colossal children of a vengeful god are on the rise, and the party has no time to waste. Compared to what other creatures people of the Drylands ride, is your character’s mount unique? Select their mount from the list below, or make up your own. Horse Dire Wolf Giant Turtle Buffalo Rhinoceros Giant Toad Deer Giant Goat Giant Scorpion Elk Giant Jackalope Giant Centipede Bear Giant Rattlesnake Shadow Beast Mountain Lion Giant Lizard Robotic Mount GM PRINCIPLES Keep the following guidance in mind while you GM this campaign. Contrast the Mundane and the Extraordinary Before the first colossus appeared in Wyllin’s Gulch, things were pretty ordinary. Folks came in on the one train, sought their fortunes mining or panning for essentia, spent their meager earnings on liquor at the bar, kept their mount fed and their belly (mostly) full, and tried to stay out of the way if a posse rode through town. Now, with the colossus rampaging, the mines are flush with power to the point of explosion, and creatures are forming seemingly overnight. Unfortunately, the impending arrival of the First Doom does nothing to dissuade the impending arrival of debt collectors, and the essentia refineries still hunger for fuel. The cataclysmic foes threatening the Drylands become more apocalyptic when juxtaposed against mundane moments found only in these small towns. Emphasize Scope and Scale The Drylands are a big place. The mesas are massive, the sky stretches as far as the eye can see, and something about the darkness of the nights feels infinite. This is a place that makes one feel small, even on a normal day. The sprawling geography is a perpetual reminder of the true insignificance of civilization’s footprint. Confrontations with the colossi should serve as a reminder: the adventurers are but ants to them, scaling their bodies and stinging them with tiny weapons. Their destruction is calamitous—a single footstep could level a town. Let both the colossi and the landscape feel immense. Make Colossi an Allegory for Personal Woe The colossi are destructive beings formed from aspects of Kudamat’s soul and the environment they inhabit—but they can also serve as allegories for the PCs’ personal journeys. When you can, use these behemoths to address the themes of the campaign, informed by the PCs’ choices and their backstories. In your session zero, make note of themes or struggles the players want to highlight in their characters’ backstories… then make them gigantic. For example, if one of the characters has a past with a corrupt small-town sheriff with too much influence and a finger in everyone’s business, you could utilize Zuudra, the Many Arms of Calamity (see the upcoming “The Children of Godfell” section) as a metaphor to represent the sheriff’s destructive overreach and the inescapable grip he holds on the outpost. Offer Chances for Creative Solutions to Colossal Problems Some players may be satisfied with simply climbing a colossus and jabbing sharp things into their weak points until they die. Other players might come up with elaborate plans and traps, or even attempt to tame a colossus. Lean into these opportunities for player creativity, giving them plenty of nails until they figure out what hammer they want to use when tackling these monstrous beasts. Each colossi should have a unique personality, physicality, and weakness that encourages the players’ ingenuity. COLOSSUS OF THE DRYLANDS 313 Chapter 5: Colossus of the Drylands"

COLOSSUS OF THE DRYLANDS 313 Chapter 5: Colossus of the Drylands\n-- 314 of 415 --\nDISTINCTIONS Use this information to prepare your campaign. You can also share it with your players as needed. The Children of Godfell Each of Kudamat’s nine soul shards are protected by a colossus known as a Child of Godfell. These beings are physical manifestations of the god’s will, hellbent on protecting their soul shard as its power is siphoned back to the mountain. Formed by elements of the soul shard’s surroundings, each is unique in personality, form, and capabilities. You’ll need nine colossi to populate the area around Godfell Mountain and guard Kudamat’s soul shards. You can use any of the colossi from the list below as inspiration, or make your own. (See the “Colossal Adversaries” section on page 318 for mechanical guidance on building a colossus.) Example Children of Godfell Aandira, the One Who Devours: Her form is a mix of humanoid and spider, and she scurries across the Drylands on bent-back limb with a dozen mouths of broken teeth. Aikar, Shepherd of the Meek: This bipedal colossus has two arms affixed with bladed shields, allowing them to deflect and deliver blows with ease. Aikar’s howl can stop living creatures in their tracks. Aphedos, the Creeping Darkness: Aphedos is formed from thousands of flies that operate independently. Impossible to climb, he must be brought down by alternate means. Balorma, the Blooming Hornwolf: This wolf bears elk horns formed of flourishing plant life. When she steps, she plants roots that suck the life from all they touch. Chakantis, He Who Knows the End: This crystalline beetle’s wingbeats rain down deadly shards onto the ground, and his abdomen can vibrate at high frequency, shattering even stone. Daktadae, the Cleaver: A massive steel rhinoceros formed from a steam train, a cleaver emerging from his head instead of a horn. He seeks vengeance upon those who’ve harmed him in the past. Eriphisia, the Radiant Light of Eternal Cleansing: A crystalline statue whose dozens of eyes cast blinding light upon the world. They reflect the sun upon victims as a ray of white, hot death. Ga’mor, the Shade of Quick Death: Ga’mor is formed from the shadows of mountains, buildings, and people. When this amalgam steps into new darkness, they can adjust their shape to match the bounds of the shadow. Heladra, Sower of Sorrows: This cloaked figure weeps waterfalls from unseen eyes, flooding the land wherever she travels. Ikeri, Injuries Untold: This apelike creature has the face of a bird. They are made of stone and carry an enormous mesa upon their back. Impahk, They Who Know No Rest: This massive desert cyclone never stops moving and consumes all they touch. Kelir, the Virulent Hate and Her Hundred, Hundred Children: A crablike, mountainous beast whose children scurry in and around her, bringing food as tribute. Mirmett, the Lover of the Hollow Hearts. This giant humanoid cage places enemies inside themself to be killed or eaten by the creatures that live within them. Moraidus, the Keeper of Graves: This centipede is formed from grave dirt and tombstones. Their arms are made of skeletons that hang from their composite form, reaching and scrabbling for anything that comes near. Nocte, the Invisible Tide: Imperceptible to the eye, Nocte swims through the ground like a fish through water and attacks from below, pulling his victims into an early grave. Oosha, Eerrae, and Yyisu, Three Who Parse Infinity: These three humanoid figures can fight separately or come together as one terrifying form. They cut their victims into pieces with rusted blades. Poy, Sky Skimmer of the Dust Sea: This massive shoebill stork is formed from the dust of the Drylands and traps enemies in their cavernous beak. Quelle, the Innocent Pain: A feline creature covered in thousands of burrowing tendrils, Quelle is fascinated by living beings and tears their enemies apart to look inside. Syan’til, the Serpent of the Last Light: A serpent of lightning, Syan’til races down from the sky to strike with blazing speed. Takkan, the Bone Bearer: Built from hundreds of bones from deep within the earth, Takkan’s form is ever-shifting and ever-grinding as she moves. Usandi, the Bear of Five Faces: Able to see in all directions, Usandi has a ring of snapping teeth around his neck, sharpened spine bones jutting out of his back, and thrashing claws running up his limbs. Vian and Naiv, the Makers of Undoing: These vespertilian beasts corrode what they touch until it falls to dust. They can only be killed by simultaneously striking weak points on both creatures. Xehamras, the Last Breath: Xehamras suffocates his victims, consuming their dying breath to increase his power, all while barking raspy laughter from his coyote head. Zuudra, the Many Arms of Calamity: This cephalopod has eight writhing limbs that rapidly shift between hardened stone spikes and rivers of flowing magma.

COLOSSUS OF THE DRYLANDS 314 Chapter 5: Colossus of the Drylands\n-- 315 of 415 --\nDesigning Your Own Colossus When you create colossi, ask yourself the following questions: • What do they look like? Are they similar to an animal, do they resemble a particular player ancestry, or are they built from pieces of the physical landscape? Alternatively, they could be an amalgamation of many things. • What is their personality? Are they quick to dispatch their enemies, or do they toy with their victims? Are they completely loyal to Kudamat, or do they enjoy learning about mortals? They could have many different aspects to their thinking and worldview. • How do they move? Do they lumber across the landscape, fly on feathered wings, or disappear into the earth and appear elsewhere? They could also utilize different forms of movement based on the terrain or situation. • What abilities do they have? They may attack many enemies at once with a flurry of arms, conjure an army of ravenous shadow beasts, or rip memories from the minds of their targets. Consider how they’d attack at their strongest, but also how they’d act when they’re gravely injured. • What is their weakness? Are they vulnerable to fire or another element? Do they undergo a transformation that leaves them open to attack? Are they a pair of colossi who are strong together but weak when separated? Find ways to give the characters openings to defeat these larger- than-life enemies. • How does the colossus relate to the themes the players want to explore? You might create a colossus that animates the dead if characters have experienced grief, a colossus that grows plants wherever they step if the campaign focuses on the destruction of the environment, or a colossus that corrodes all they touch if characters begin to doubt if their actions are heroic. The Soul Shards No one knows exactly where each soul shard is located, but regions overrun with aberrations and supercharged essentia indicate that a shard is nearby. When Kudamat locates a soul shard and begins siphoning power from it, the ground around it quakes with a single, powerful tremor, and the vein of essentia supercharged by his power glows brightly, day and night. This helps the locals pinpoint the soul shard’s location with more accuracy, so to prevent it from being found, Kudamat simultaneously creates a sentinel: a colossus who stalks and guards that entire region. Once a colossus is slain, the soul shard they defended shatters deep beneath the earth, causing a ring of essentia to violently erupt out of the ground in a mile radius around the shard’s location. Destroying these shards prevents Kudamat from absorbing further power—the sooner each shard is shattered, the less power Kudamat will have when he emerges from the mountain at the end of the campaign (see the upcoming “Emergence of Kudamat” section for more details). The Aberrations From the divine power surging through the veins of essentia come new and terrible beasts. These aberrations are smaller than the colossi, but share the same goal: keep all creatures away from the soul shards. Some even resemble the colossi they serve, wielding similar forms or abilities as their titanic counterparts. Any existing adversaries can be reflavored as an aberration, but you can build your own as well. When creating aberrations, ask yourself the following questions: • What do they look like? Similar to the colossi, these are twisted and terrible beings never before seen in the Mortal Realm. They usually resemble their surrounding landscape, a characteristic they embody, or the colossi they serve. • Where can they be found? When you imagine them in the Drylands, consider how they might hunt in the environment they populate. These creatures range in size from miniscule to the size of a house, and each aberration will operate differently. • What powers do they have? Do they resemble a nearby colossus? Or are they something else entirely? Some of the aberrations might fight in packs, have only one powerful ability, or wear the party down with sheer numbers. Essentia All magic in the Drylands is powered by essentia, and without the crystals and batteries made from them, magic users cannot access this power. Had the life forces of the Forgotten Gods not crystallized on the Mortal Plane, its inhabitants would never have harnessed the power of magic. Across the realm, since the dawn of mortalkind, people have mined the earth and plumbed the seas for these crystals of power. But it’s only within the recent past that people learned that, while the raw essentia crystals can provide enormous power, it’s more reliable (and often a more efficient use of less-potent stones) to manufacture batteries. These “essentia cells” are now widely available across the realm, making magic more accessible and the Drylands increasingly wealthy. Ask players about their character’s relationship with essentia. • Are they willing to harness the life essence of ancient gods, or do they consider it a profanity? • Do they install raw or polished essentia crystals in their armor or weapons, or do they utilize modern essentia cells? • How do they acquire new essentia when their crystals or cells wear out? Do they purchase it in shops, steal it, or mine it as they travel? COLOSSUS OF THE DRYLANDS 315 Chapter 5: Colossus of the Drylands"

COLOSSUS OF THE DRYLANDS 315 Chapter 5: Colossus of the Drylands\n-- 316 of 415 --\nDrylands Outposts Since the Essentia Rush began about 40 years ago, settlements like Wyllin’s Gulch formed around Godfell Mountain. Some are small encampments, while others are bustling towns cut through by dirt streets. But no matter their size, they’re always referred to as outposts, because everyone knows that once the local essentia veins are cleaned out, people will have their town packed up overnight. Below are a few of the larger outposts, but you’re encouraged to make your own: The Cinderline: Named for the unique black sand the town is built upon, the Cinderline sprung up around a river that washed bits of essentia into a nice deposit downstream, though no one has successfully panned for essentia in the last few years. Locals are fiercely protective of their water supply, as this outpost is the last stop for fresh water before a long stretch of desert. Havalaugh: The name sounds as cordial as the folks in this encampment. Though there isn’t a permanent building in sight, the tents that form this town stretch for at least a mile. Run by someone known only as Pickens (they/them), Havalaugh is fairly receptive to outsiders. The outpost is considered to host the premier marketplace on the eastern side of the mountain, and its High Summer Festival is famous—enough for Havalaugh to nearly quintuple its size for a week. There’s no sheriff in Havalaugh, but anyone who harms a citizen is never heard from again. The Iron Kettle: One of the more industrialized outposts in the region, the Iron Kettle is built around a massive mine owned by Iron Tusk Corp. Because of the talent needed to construct the mining infrastructure, it’s a rustic place full of skilled smiths and crafters, many of whom sell goods to travelers outside their work for Iron Tusk. This need for steel goods has given the smiths more power than Iron Tusk would prefer. But a powerful trade union formed by the smiths keeps them in check and governs “The Kettle,” taking the onus (and liability) off the company. Pryor: Built into a long-abandoned essentia mine, Pryor is often unnoticed by those who don’t know where to look as they ride by. The folk that live in this insular outpost are not known to welcome guests, but if you have a contact who can get you in their good graces, you’re likely to learn the best tricks of the Drylands from the citizens of Pryor. Most of these families stretch back to the time before the Essentia Rush, when there were only a few folk mining these lands. Defiance: Famous for its position high atop a mesa, Defiance is an outpost rumored to have been established by a band of thieves looking to escape the law—and its position certainly provides a good view of anyone coming their way. These vagrants have a considerable cache of artillery aimed at the ground below, and they aren’t known to fire warning shots. THE INCITING INCIDENT You can use the prompt below to start your campaign, or create your own. When the first colossus rose outside Wyllin’s Gulch, most people spent a considerable amount of time panicking. The sheriff raised a small army to fight it, a band of brave miners piled old equipment in its path, and the factories shuttered to protect their stores of essentia. But every effort was ineffective in stopping the massive creature’s path of destruction After seeing most of his deputies die in a single crushing blow, Mayor Logan Hartly (she/her) put out an ad. “Help Wanted. Whoever can dispatch the colossus and its pack of abberations will receive a chest of fully processed essentia.” It’s a good deal for anyone who can manage to fight the gigantic force of nature and live to tell the tale. Meanwhile, Baron Ryder Destry (he/him)—his name, not a title—recently learned that Kudamat’s efforts to siphon the power of his soul has supercharged the veins of essentia connected to the shard, making the stones ten times as valuable. He’s offering “an army’s supply of powerful essentia” to anyone who will collaborate with the colossus to stand guard around the soul shard until Kudamat completes his ritual. Destry swears his factory guard can keep Wyllin’s Gulch safe, and he’ll keep his teams mining the powerful essentia night and day. The party was assembled by the mayor’s “Help Wanted” ad, but Destry’s offer put more than a few wrenches in an already near-impossible plan. Numerous groups with their eye on Destry’s prize are already on their way to the colossus to help it guard Kudamat’s soul shard. In addition, smaller aberrations have begun to rise from the veins of essentia to aid their titanic counterpart. If the party can manage to fight their way through these smaller adversaries, they’ll have to topple a colossus, a feat no one in the Drylands has ever accomplished. Will the party take the offer from the mayor, or give up the effort to stand alongside the colossus while Destry continues to mine the supercharged essentia? Can they play both sides? Will Hartly keep her word if they manage to topple the colossus? Can the party kill the massive creation before it destroys Wyllin’s Gulch, or any of the smaller outposts nearby? Once they’ve destroyed this colossus, are the stories true, with another rise to fulfill the Prophecy of the Drylands? COLOSSUS OF THE DRYLANDS 316 Chapter 5: Colossus of the Drylands"

Once the party finds out a new colossus has risen in the Drylands, they are in the hunt phase. During the hunt phase, they should be riding into the relevant outpost, gathering information they need for their hunt, saving innocents from newly released aberrations, tracking down the colossus, and battling them. During a hunt, the threat of the colossus should always feel present, even from a distance. A hunt might last a few days to a week, but it should feel as though every moment counts as Kudamat siphons power from his soul shard and the colossus wreaks havoc. Once the colossus is slain, the party moves into the interlude phase. During the interlude phase, PCs have time to take on smaller, more personal tasks throughout the region— perhaps a band of ruffians keeps robbing people outside the local saloon, a train was derailed by an eruption of essentia and is now missing, or a farmer’s cattle keep was devoured by something strange in the night. An interlude might last a few days to a few weeks or more, depending on the players’ desires. Colossal Adversaries This campaign frame introduces a unique adversary type: Colossus. If you are running this campaign, you’ll need to build colossi for your party to fight. This section provides some Colossus adversary examples, as well as guidance for how to design and run your own. Colossus Stat Blocks Because they’re so large, colossi use multiple adversary stat blocks, each one representing a segment of their form. For example, you might decide you want to build out Ikeri, Injuries Untold. You could divide their segments into six stat blocks: two legs, two arms, a torso, and a head. Additionally, these segment stat blocks exist within the colossus framework, a stat block that holds the information and features that apply to the colossus as a whole. Some segments can be Broken. While Broken, the segment can't use actions or reactions until the condition is cleared. When a segment marks its last Hit Point, it’s considered Destroyed. A Destroyed segment can no longer use any of its features. A colossus is defeated when all their segments are Destroyed, but colossi often have an alternative way to be defeated, as well. When a segment is Destroyed, that doesn’t mean it’s gone or detached—it simply doesn’t work anymore. You can use the following Tier 1 stat block as your party’s first colossus encounter, and it also serves as a template you can use to make your own colossi. The sections after the Tier 1 colossus stat blocks provide additional feature examples, guidance for running colossi, and more example stat blocks at higher tiers.

PASSIVES The following are examples of passive features. Fatal - Passive: When this segment is Destroyed, the colossus is defeated. Chain - Passive: When all segments in this chain are Destroyed, the colossus is defeated. This feature might appear as Chain (A) or Chain (B) for clarity across multiple segment chains. Strike (Melee) - Passive: This segment is immune to damage from attacks not made within Melee range. Melee could be replaced with any range to change up this feature. Armored - Passive: When this segment marks HP from an attack, it marks 1 fewer HP. Climbing (+3) - Passive: This segment’s Difficulty gains a +3 bonus against action rolls made to climb it. This could also be a negative number, such as –3, which would mean the Difficulty to climb is reduced. Not Climbable - Passive: This segment can’t be climbed. Weak Point - Passive: The colossus has a weak point on this segment. When this segment marks HP from an attack made within Melee range, it marks an additional HP. Typically, hitting the weak point of a segment while within Melee range causes the colossus to mark an additional HP, but hitting weak points can have other effects! Feel free to experiment with other outcomes. Maybe that segment can’t be used for a few GM turns, or its damage is halved the next time it’s spotlighted. ACTIONS The following are examples of action features. Shake Off - Action: Spend a Fear to throw off foes. All creatures on the colossus must make a Strength Reaction Roll. Targets who fail fall to the ground and must mark a HP. Targets who succeed must mark a Stress. Kudamat’s Rage - Action: Spend 2 Fear to force all PCs within Very Far range to succeed on a Presence Reaction Roll or become Shaken. While Shaken, they don't gain Hope on a result with Hope and instead clear the Shaken condition. REACTIONS The following are examples of reaction features. Swatting Pests - Reaction: When the colossus is attacked by a flying target within Far range, you can make a standard attack against the attacker. On a success, add a d20 to the damage roll and the target is knocked to the ground within Far range. Collapsed - Reaction: When the colossus marks at least 1 HP on all Leg segments, it Collapses. While the colossus is Collapsed, segments that aren’t accessible from the ground can be climbed. This reaction is typically used in conjunction with the “Not Climbable” passive feature. You can always change the trigger out for something that makes more sense within the fiction as it occurs. Colossal Power - Reaction: When the colossus fails an attack, you gain a Fear. Segment vs. Colossus Effects When a feature refers to a specific segment’s name, such as “the Head,” it’s only referring to that specific part of the colossus. For example, the Head might be immune to physical attacks or be more difficult to climb. When a feature refers to the colossus’s name, such as “Ikeri,” it’s talking about the adversary as a whole. For example, a reaction feature might trigger an attack after Ikeri marks 2 or more Hit Points from a single attack. This would mean that when any segment marks 2 or more Hit Points from a single attack, the reaction is triggered. Adjacent Segments Make sure to note which segments are adjacent to one another. When climbing on a colossus, PCs will only be able to traverse segments that are adjacent (see the upcoming “Moving PCs Around a Colossus” section). 320 Chapter 5: Colossus of the Drylands"

Perhaps certain segments can only be attacked once other segments are Destroyed, or each segment has its own damage thresholds, or a certain parameter has to be satisfied before the colossus can be hit at all. Maybe the colossus only takes Major damage, ignoring other severities, or is only harmed by a certain type of weapon, requiring the party to hunt down those weapons before the fight. The earlier example features, particularly the passives, can help you create these puzzles, but feel free to invent your own. As you become more comfortable with epic-scale fights, we encourage you to ramp up the adversaries to your preferred level of complexity—but don’t be afraid to start simple! Running Colossus Fights Because of the scale of the fight, battles against colossi have some unique rules to use and guidance to follow. SCALE Unlike normal range in Daggerheart, we use a standard form of measurement when talking about a colossus’s scale. (In our case, we use feet—but you should use whatever you find easiest.) Normal range bands still apply when taking actions and are at GM discretion as usual, but expressing the height or width of a creature through recognizable sizes helps the table to understand the scale of the colossus they’re facing. MOVING PCS AROUND A COLOSSUS During an encounter, it’s expected that PCs will scale the colossus. Rather than the normal movement rules, use the following guidelines: • PCs can climb onto each colossus segment unless a segment notes otherwise in its stat block. • Once a PC is on a segment, they can usually move around that segment of the colossus without having to make additional rolls. • To move to an adjacent segment, the PC must make the appropriate action roll (usually Agility or Strength) to leap onto it. TEAMWORK While fighting a colossus, PCs may initiate any number of Tag Team Rolls. USING A COLOSSUS IN BATTLE On your GM turn, treat each segment of a colossus as its own adversary when moving the spotlight. You can spotlight a segment as your GM move, then spend a Fear to spotlight an additional segment as you would during a fight with regular adversaries. Some colossi also have actions in their colossus framework; you can spotlight the framework to use this action as you would spotlight a segment, but you should highlight the colossus as a whole in the narrative. You can still spotlight additional segments on your turn. While a PC is on a segment of the colossus: • They have advantage on attacks against that segment. • The segment’s standard attack cannot be used on that PC. For example, they can’t grab a PC who’s riding on their hand! The colossus would need to use a different segment to attack them. Any feature that allows a segment to attack a PC who’s currently on that segment will call it out in its description. For example, the “Shake Off” feature specifies “all creatures on the colossus,” meaning it would include creatures on that segment. Any features that would pull or push normal adversaries can’t move a colossus; instead, the feature pulls or pushes the PC making the attack. For example, using a grappler against a colossus can’t pull them toward you, but instead pulls you toward them. Any time an effect is targeting the colossus, use the Difficulty of the segment being targeted. If an effect targets a colossus as a collective, use the highest Difficulty amongst all the segments. If a PC’s feature targets multiple adversaries, it can target multiple segments. Typically when fighting a colossus, there is no need to add additional adversaries to the encounter—colossi are powerful enough on their own! If you do want to have other adversaries involved, think about their relationship with the colossus. Are they an aberration? Do they find the colossus useful for their own purposes? We recommend keeping additional adversaries limited and purposeful, or a fight can become unwieldy. Lastly, give the characters information about how to take down a colossus, and consider how that information can be creatively delivered. Part of the hunt phase should include the PCs tracking down knowledge about the colossus before facing it; you’re encouraged to seed rumors from townspeople about what they’ve seen, then provide payoff when some of those rumors are proven true during the fight. Additionally, examine the colossus’s stat block and plan ways you might give clues about its physical body using color, light, and shape to telegraph important information. If you describe heavy armor that surrounds a delicate blue light pulsing in the core of the chest, they’ll have a pretty good idea where the weak point is and the armor they need to contend with. Think about how you can use all of a character’s senses to convey the mechanics of the colossus and use them to narratively guide your players along the monstrous beast. For example, this segment’s skin feels squishier than the other parts of this creature they’ve been on, or the smell is getting more putrid the higher they climb, or they can hear a shrill cry getting louder as they move toward the tail. 321 Chapter 5: Colossus of the Drylands"

When a PC climbs onto a segment of the colossus, place their miniature directly on the notecard. This setup can help you and the players remember where each PC is and which segments are adjacent to them. It can also help you visualize how you can use each segment’s features and shake up the battle. Example Colossi The following stat blocks provide example colossi for each additional tier of play.

After defeating all nine colossi, the PCs will be at level 10 and ready to take on Kudamat as their last hunt. Emergence of Kudamat During the campaign, you’ll keep track of the power Kudamat is siphoning from the soul shards. Copy the following trackers into your notebook. Siphoning Track:  Kudamat’s Power: ___ The Siphoning Track starts with one slot marked, and Kudamat’s power starts at a value of 0. When the PCs take a short rest during the hunt phase, mark the Siphoning Track once. When the PCs take a long rest during the hunt phase, mark the Siphoning Track twice. Each time a colossus is defeated, or when the Siphoning Track is full, roll as many d12s as marked slots to determine how much power the soul shard gives back to Kudamat. Increase Kudamat’s Power by the highest value rolled, then reset the Siphoning Track to 1. Once all nine colossi have been slain or his Power reaches 100, Kudamat emerges from Godfell Mountain. Build him as a Colossus adversary with a Severe threshold equal to the value of Kudamat’s Power and a Major threshold equal to half that value (rounded up). SESSION ZERO QUESTIONS Ask any of these questions to your players, or make your own. • Is your character native to the Drylands, or did they come from elsewhere? How have they been treated by the locals and incoming prospectors? • What is your character’s favorite thing about the geography of the Drylands? Do they have a notable landmark they’re drawn to? • Since the rise of the colossi, who or what has your character lost, and how did that event change them? • Some believe that, despite the prophecy, Kudamat will bring prosperity to mortals when he rises. Does your character believe this? How do they interact with the people who do? • Describe an outpost your character visited in the past. What did they love about it? What worried them? • What terrors has your character seen roaming the desert now that Kudamat is raising ever more aberrations? • What themes are you most interested in exploring with your characters, and how might they manifest in some of the colossi?

Domain Card reference ARCANA DOMAIN RUNE WARD Level 1 Arcana Spell Recall Cost: 0 You have a deeply personal trinket that can be infused with protective magic and held as a ward by you or an ally. Describe what it is and why it’s important to you. The ward’s holder can spend a Hope to reduce incoming damage by 1d8. If the Ward Die result is 8, the ward’s power ends after it reduces damage this turn. It can be recharged for free on your next rest. UNLEASH CHAOS Level 1 Arcana Spell Recall Cost: 1 At the beginning of a session, place a number of tokens equal to your Spellcast trait on this card. Make a Spellcast Roll against a target within Far range and spend any number of tokens to channel raw energy from within yourself to unleash against them. On a success, roll a number of d10s equal to the tokens you spent and deal that much magic damage to the target. Mark a Stress to replenish this card with tokens (up to your Spellcast trait). At the end of each session, clear all unspent tokens. WALL WALK Level 1 Arcana Spell Recall Cost: 1 Spend a Hope to allow a creature you can touch to climb on walls and ceilings as easily as walking on the ground. This lasts until the end of the scene or you cast Wall Walk again. CINDER GRASP Level 2 Arcana Spell Recall Cost: 1 Make a Spellcast Roll against a target within Melee range. On a success, the target instantly bursts into flames, takes 1d20+3 magic damage, and is temporarily lit On Fire. When a creature acts while On Fire, they must take an extra 2d6 magic damage if they are still On Fire at the end of their action. FLOATING EYE Level 2 Arcana Spell Recall Cost: 0 Spend a Hope to create a single, small floating orb that you can move anywhere within Very Far range. While this spell is active, you can see through the orb as though you’re looking out from its position. You can transition between using your own senses and seeing through the orb freely. If the orb takes damage or moves out of range, the spell ends. COUNTERSPELL Level 3 Arcana Spell Recall Cost: 2 You can interrupt a magical effect taking place by making a reaction roll using your Spellcast trait. On a success, the effect stops and any consequences are avoided, and this card is placed in your vault. FLIGHT Level 3 Arcana Spell Recall Cost: 1 Make a Spellcast Roll (15). On a success, place a number of tokens equal to your Agility on this card (minimum 1). When you make an action roll while flying, spend a token from this card. After the action that spends the last token is resolved, you descend to the ground directly below you. BLINK OUT Level 4 Arcana Spell Recall Cost: 1 Make a Spellcast Roll (12). On a success, spend a Hope to teleport to another point you can see within Far range. If any willing creatures are within Very Close range, spend an additional Hope for each creature to bring them with you. PRESERVATION BLAST Level 4 Arcana Spell Recall Cost: 2 Make a Spellcast Roll against all targets within Melee range. Targets you succeed against are forced back to Far range and take d8+3 magic damage using your Spellcast trait. CHAIN LIGHTNING Level 5 Arcana Spell Recall Cost: 1 Mark 2 Stress to make a Spellcast Roll, unleashing lightning on all targets within Close range. Targets you succeed against must make a reaction roll with a Difficulty equal to the result of your Spellcast Roll. Targets who fail take 2d8+4 magic damage. Additional adversaries not already targeted by Chain Lightning and within Close range of previous targets who took damage must also make the reaction roll. Targets who fail take 2d8+4 magic damage.

PRIMARY SECONDARY PRIMARY SECONDARY HOPE FEATURE DAGGERHEART CHARACTER SHEET\n-- 344 of 415 --\nDaggerheart © Darrington Press 2025 This section denotes your class. Each class is made up of two domains. You choose your abilities and spells from these domains. This section gives you a place to record your name, pronouns, heritage (the combination of your community and ancestry), and subclass. There is also a space to record your level. This is where you record your Hope. You spend Hope to use an Experience (details below), Help an Ally, use a Hope Feature, or initiate a Tag Team Roll. When you Help an Ally, you explain how you’re aiding them and roll a d6 advantage die they add to their action roll total. You start with 2 Hope marked. Your class’s unique Hope Feature is in this section as well. This is where you keep track of your gold during a campaign. If you would mark your tenth handful, you instead mark a bag and erase all your handfuls. If you would mark your tenth bag, you instead mark a chest and erase your bags. You start with one handful of gold. Your inventory is where you store items and consumables. Each class starts with a unique class feature that sets them apart from other classes. Make sure to read through them before you begin playing. This is where you store weapons you want to carry but not have active. While a weapon is in your inventory, you can’t benefit from its feature. SLIDE THIS SIDE OUT TO THE RIGHT OF YOUR CHARACTER SHEET. SLIDE THIS SIDE OUT TO THE LEFT OF YOUR CHARACTER SHEET. Experience represents your character’s particular specializations your character has. These are narrative tags that you create to reflect what your character is skilled in. When they apply to the scene, you can spend a Hope before the action roll to add an Experience’s value as a modifier. You earn more Experiences throughout a campaign. This is the section for your armor. Along with a name, armor has base thresholds that contribute to your damage thresholds, and a base score that contributes to your Armor Score. The armor’s feature describes its special abilities or the requirements to use it. Evasion represents your ability to avoid an attack. The GM rolls against this number when determining if an adversary hits you. If you do get hit, you can choose to mark an Armor Slot (the small empty shields to the right of the large “Armor” shield) to reduce the severity of the incoming damage by one threshold. You have a number of available slots equal to your Armor Score (the number in the large “Armor” shield). This area contains your six character traits. You use these as your primary modifiers on action rolls. The descriptions beneath each trait remind you how to use them. The two smaller boxes are your damage thresholds. These come from your armor, and you always add your level to their value. When you take damage, compare it to the numbers here. If the incoming damage is Minor, you mark a Hit Point. If it is Major, you mark 2 Hit Points. If it is Severe, you mark 3 Hit Points. If you ever need to mark Stress and can’t, mark a Hit Point. If you ever mark your last Hit Point, you must make a death move. This is the section for your active weapons. Along with a name, weapons have an associated trait that you roll when using them for an attack. They also have a range (Melee, Very Close, Close, Far, or Very Far). The GM tells you what range a target is at relative to your character. Damage dice are the kind of dice you roll when you make a successful attack, and the damage type is either physical or magic. Proficiency tells you how many damage dice you roll. A weapon’s feature describes its special abilities or the requirements to use it. Weapons are either one-handed or two-handed. Fill in the appropriate number of hands based on the weapons you take. character sheet sidecar"

Take the character sheet specific to this class. Each class has a number of subclasses to choose from that help define what kind of focus you’d like your character to have. Take the foundation card for your chosen subclass. CHOOSE A HERITAGE Your character’s heritage is made up of both an ancestry and a community card. These two cards establish your character’s physical appearance and the environment they grew up in. ASSIGN CHARACTER TRAITS Distribute the values −1, 0, 0, +1, +1, +2 across your character traits. When rolling, you’ll add the value of that character trait to the roll. RECORD CHARACTER INFORMATION Next, record your starting Evasion. Additionally, gain 2 Hope to start the game. CHOOSE STARTING EQUIPMENT Decide which weapons you want to start the game with and record their details in the appropriate spaces in the “Active Weapons” section.CHOOSE SMOR Next, take one of the available options for starting armor and record its details in the appropriate spaces. Your armor comes with its own damage thresholds and base armor score. Record this alongside your selection under “Active Armor.” Add your thresholds to your level and record those numbers under the “Damage & Health” section. Also record the Base Armor Score, plus modifiers from any features, in the large shield labeled “Armor” at the top of the sheet. The starting inventory for your class is listed on your character guide. Record those items in the “Inventory” section of your character sheet. CREATE YOUR BACKGROUND Make description choices from the available options on your character guide (or create your own). This will help you start to build out your character’s look and attitude. Then use the background questions on your character guide as a jumping-off point to build out your character’s history (or create your own questions). Finally, name your character and choose which pronouns they use. CREATE YOUR EXPERIENCES Use all the choices and backstory you’ve made about your character so far to generate their starting two Experiences, a set of narrative words or phrases that represent what they’ve learned or become on their journey so far. Assign both a modifier of +2. CHOOSE DOMAIN DECK CARDS Each class is made up of two different domains, which are listed below the class name on the character sheet. Choose two cards total from the level 1 cards in those domains. You can share these decks with other players. If you do, make sure to talk with them about which cards they’re interested in.ANSWERND QUESTIONS CREATE CONNECTIONS Ask any of the Connection questions on your character guide to the other players at the table (or generate your own questions).

It’s not only an opportunity to recover and prepare for what lies ahead, but also a time to share more quiet, intimate scenes that help to build or showcase the relationships characters have with one another. Level 1 Tier 1 Levels 2–4 Tier 2 Levels 5–7 Tier 3 Levels 8–10 Tier 4 ACTION ROLL RESULTS • On a critical success, you get what you want and a little extra. You gain a Hope and clear a Stress. • On a success with Hope, you pull it off well and get what you want. You gain a Hope. • On a success with Fear, you get what you want, but it comes with a cost or consequence. You might get attacked, get limited information, attract danger, or face another complication. The GM gains a Fear. • On a failure with Hope, things don’t go to plan. You probably don’t get what you want and there are consequences, but you gain a Hope. • On a failure with Fear, things go very badly. You probably don’t get what you want, and a major consequence or complication occurs because of it. The GM gains a Fear. DAMAGE ROLLS After a successful attack, roll a number of your weapon’s damage dice equal to your Proficiency and add them together. If your attack roll critically succeeds, your attack deals extra damage! Start with the highest possible value the damage dice can roll, and then make a damage roll as usual, adding it to that value. Reaction rolls Reaction rolls work similarly to action rolls, except they don’t generate Hope, Fear, or additional GM moves. USING ARMOR Your Armor Score represents how many Armor Slots you have available. When you take damage, you can mark an Armor Slot to reduce the severity by one threshold. You can only mark 1 Armor Slot per incoming attack. QUICK REFERENCE Advantage: Add a d6 advantage die to your roll. Disadvantage: Subtract a d6 disadvantage die from your roll. Help an Ally: Spend a Hope and roll a d6 advantage die to add to an ally’s roll. If the ally has gained advantage on a roll from multiple sources, they only add the highest result to their roll. Group Action: Nominate a leader of the action. All other participants in the group action roll make a reaction roll using whichever traits they and the GM decide best fit (they don’t need to use the same traits). The leader then makes an action roll. Their action roll gains a +1 bonus for each reaction roll that succeeds and a −1 penalty for each reaction roll that fails. Tag Team Roll: Once per session, each player can choose to spend 3 Hope and initiate a Tag Team Roll between their character and another PC. When you do, work with the other character’s player to describe how you combine your actions in a unique and exciting way. You both make separate action rolls, but before resolving the roll’s outcome, choose one of the rolls to apply for both of your results. On a roll with Hope, all PCs involved gain a Hope. On a roll with Fear, the GM gains a Fear for each PC involved. If you succeed on a Tag Team Roll attack, you both roll damage, then add it together to determine the damage dealt. Vulnerable: When a creature has the Vulnerable condition, all rolls against them have advantage. Restrained: When a creature has the Restrained condition, they can’t move, but they can still take actions from their current position. Hidden: While you’re out of sight from all foes and they don’t know where you are, you gain the Hidden condition. While you’re Hidden, any rolls against you have disadvantage. Direct Damage: Armor Slots can’t be marked to reduce this damage. Critical Success! If the Hope and Fear Die both land on the same number, it’s a critical success. SHORT REST Each player can swap any domain cards in their loadout for cards in their vault, then choose two of the following moves (or choose the same move twice). The GM gains 1d4 Fear. • Tend to Wounds Describe how you hastily patch yourself up, then clear a number of Hit Points equal to 1d4 + your tier. You can do this to an ally instead. • Clear Stress Describe how you blow off steam or pull yourself together, then clear a number of Stress equal to 1d4 + your tier. • Repair Armor Describe how you quickly repair your armor, then clear a number of Armor Slots equal to 1d4 + your tier. You can do this to an ally’s armor instead. • Prepare Describe how you prepare yourself for the path ahead, then gain a Hope. If you choose to Prepare with one or more members of your party, you each gain 2 Hope. LONG REST Each player can swap any domain cards in their loadout for cards in their vault, then choose two of the following moves (or choose the same move twice). The GM gains an amount of Fear equal to the number of PCs + 1d4 and can advance a long-term countdown. • Tend to All Wounds Describe how you patch yourself up, then clear all Hit Points. You can do this to an ally instead. • Clear All Stress Describe how you blow off steam or pull yourself together, then clear all Stress. • Repair All Armor Describe how you spend time repairing your armor, then clear all Armor Slots. You can do this to an ally’s armor instead. • Prepare Describe how you prepare for the next day’s adventure, then gain a Hope. If you choose to Prepare with one or more members of your party, you each gain 2 Hope. • Work on a Project Establish or continue work on a project. The GM might ask for a roll to determine how much to tick down the progress countdown. PLAY GUIDE 12 6 6 6 Roll your Duality Dice and add them together along with your modifiers.

GM Principles: Begin and end with the fiction - Collaborate at all times, especially during conflict - Fill the world with life, wonder, and danger - Ask questions and incorporate the answers - Make every roll important - Play to find out what happens - Hold on gently GM Best Practices: Cultivate a curious table - Gain your players’ trust - Keep the story moving forward - Cut to the action - Help the players use the game - Create a meta conversation - Tell them what they would know - Ground the world in motive - Bring the game’s mechanics to life - Reframe rather than reject - Work in moments and montages Example GM MOves • Show how the world reacts. “The kick shatters the door. Light spills in from the barracks as a half-dozen sleepy soldiers stumble to their feet, looking worried.” • Ask a question and build on the answer. “How is it that you notice the assassin lurking in the treetops?” • Make an NPC act in accordance with their motive. “The Jagged Knife Bandit snips the gold purse off the merchant’s hip and attempts to escape.” • Lean on the character’s goals to drive them to action. “The relic you’ve been trying to recover for your people floats ominously in the center of the altar, surrounded by cultists preparing to drain its power.” • Signal an imminent off- screen threat. “You hear the crashing of falling trees and shattered branches as thundering steps approach. What do you do?” • Reveal an unwelcome truth or unexpected danger. “He reaches into his cloak and produces the Orb of Vengeance as you realize that he was the necromancer the entire time.” • Force the group to split up. “The elementals are scattering—two heading for the town, three bearing down on the mill. What do you do?” • Make a PC mark Stress as a consequence for their actions. “You can pull the baron to safety if you mark a Stress. Otherwise you can only get yourself out of the way. What do you do?” • Make a move the characters don’t see. “You brace for the alarm... but the door clicks open and everything seems fine... for now.” • Show the collateral damage. “The Minotaur Wrecker barrels into the street, shattering a vegetable cart, sending cabbages flying and knocking the merchant into the wall.” • Clear a temporary condition or effect. “The guard cuts through the vines that are holding her legs in place. She looks around to find her next target and raises her sword.” • Shift the environment. “As soon as you cross, the ancient rope bridge snaps, leaving you stranded.” • Spotlight an adversary. “As the Skeleton Dredge shambles forward to strike you, you see the two others on their flank turn their attention toward you as well.” • Capture someone or something important. “The thief slides past you and jumps into the cart, grabbing the idol from the seat and stuffing it into their pouch.” • Use a PC’s backstory against them. “Your mentor sighs, drawing their blade. ‘I wish it didn’t come to this, child. But you still don’t understand what sacrifices are required to maintain the peace.’” • Take away an opportunity permanently. “The door slams shut, cutting you off from the vault as the temple continues to collapse. You’ll need to find another exit if you want to make it out alive.” Daggerheart © Darrington Press 2025 GM GUIDE"

When you do, choose one trait to raise by +1 until you drop out of that Beastform. BEASTFORM Mark a Stress to magically transform into a creature of your tier or lower from the Beastform list. You can drop out of this form at any time. While transformed, you can’t use weapons or cast spells from domain cards, but you can still use other features or abilities you have access to. Spells you cast before you transform stay active and last for their normal duration, and you can talk and communicate as normal. Additionally, you gain the Beastform’s features, add their Evasion bonus to your Evasion, and use the trait specified in their statistics for your attack. While you’re in a Beastform, your armor becomes part of your body and you mark Armor Slots as usual; when you drop out of a Beastform, those marked Armor Slots remain marked. If you mark your last Hit Point, you automatically drop out of this form.
